I think that these headphones are among the best I have ever tried and this includes the Sony WH-1000XM5 which I just purchased a few days ago.The only gripe I have about the Airpods Max is that you cannot turn it off. You have to put the headphones in their smart case in order to ""shut them down"". Even then they do not turn completely, they just go into a very low power consumption. Another is changing the EQ settings or changing any settings except volume and noise cancellation.I would not have bought these if they were still at the same original price of $549.00.However, the reduction in price was enough to try them out.I'm glad that I did.","Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2024",AGY25662YKB2YKIOPDYSUYT34AGA,True,3,Color: Sky BlueSet: Without AppleCare+

RJHVMLU4CHEUU,B08PZJN7BD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Ear Cup Fabric Trade Off: Longer Lasting Than Leather, But Slightly Rough",1B1b1,4,"I wish the overhead arch and / or arms extended slightly longer: feels borderline long enough for my particular head.I bent the overhead arch outward a bit to reduce uncomfortable clamping pressure, but not enough to eliminate the ear seal needed for noise cancelling.I bought after market, see through ear cup covers to protect against abrasion where the cans sometimes rub against each other when off my head, and also against other scrapes and nicks..Also an after market carry case to protect against travel damage. I chose the larger type that accepts the headphones inside their included case, rather than a smaller after market sleep mode case with no room for the included case.To preserve battery life, return headphone into your after market sleep mode (or included) case when not in use. Other reviewers are correct that an on / off switch would seem preferable to the insufficiently protective included case required to put the battery into sleep mode.Some after market cases advertising sleep mode, and are thus not big enough to accommodate the included case, may sometimes not always put the headphone battery into sleep mode, thus draining the battery. Read reviews of these cases to determine how often this occurs.No audio cord / receptacle—BlueTooth audio only.Delightfully quick BT automatic pairing with Apple products.Ear cups are magnetic and thus easily removable and replaceable, though a bit pricey. Marked L & R, ensure you put them back on the correct cup, with the letter upright, so sound holes align.Very good bass, but high end Sony cans seem a bit deeper. Sony WH-1000XM3 & WH-1000XM4 are a bit more comfortable for my particular head than AirPods Max, but WH-1000XM2 clamps too hard, while the 3 handles phone calls poorly. Myself and other Amazon reviewers experienced bad BT connection with Samsung TVs on the 4, so I returned the Sony. AirPods Max connects quickly to my Samsung TV, though not automatically as with Apple computers.Very / good battery life.Woman on the other end of a phone call said she was surprised how good I sounded through AirPods Max. So my after market protective can covers did not seem to affect phone sound quality.Build seems more durable than some other high end headphones, such as Sony, but they should for this price. This apparent durability also reduces Apple’s repair / replacement costs to those who purchase AppleCare+ with this headphone.","Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2021",AGNQZA264AGL2Y34DB4SGF3XTPOQ,True,3,Color: Sky BlueSet: Without AppleCare+
RIZSCIR4FP25Y,B08PZJN7BD,5.0 out of 5 stars best wireless noise cancelling headphones ever but pricey,Anonymous Reviewer 338,5,"These are great, and if you can get them on sale that makes them a better value - I didn't buy them until they began to be discounted, but having had them I would probably pay retail for them in the future if I had to replace them. When using them with an apple device with spatial audio, the effect feels like I can't tell the sound is really coming from the headphones (I lift one off to check). They're super comfy and don't feel heavy, though they're metal and that can feel cold sometimes. Transparency mode is mostly great but sometimes startles if there's a loud pop noise (bubble wrap) it will amplify it a bit. Noise cancelling is the best I've ever used, and I imagine that's due to apple putting in adequate computational power into these to permit smarter/better cancellation.These look to be modular - it should possible to separately replace the headband or either ear unit using a SIM card tool - so it's slightly reparable by Apple as they don't sell those parts separately. I worry about how the head band will age or get dirty with time or if the fabric frays (it hasn't), and it looks like it can be replaced if needed. Replacement fabric ear pads are sold by apple if they get grungy but pricey.Battery life seems very long, and they charge quickly. The case is weird looking, but works well enough in my laptop bag. Materials and construction feel are top notch, these headphones feel and look very premium, though I'm not a huge fan of their color selection and the look of the ear units (too rectangular and too much like an apple watch). I would love for them to eventually sell these in more/better colors, and to even permit mix-match of different colors for the ear units and headband or even sell them separately. I also worry that apple will discontinue or alter these so that in the future it won't be possible to replace or repair parts. I have an old headphone set from another company, and I've replaced the cord and pads on that a few times over the years. I think with these it would be nice if battery, pads, and headband could be replaced for years into the future, but I doubt that that will be the case. I'm still OK with it given how much I like these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2021",AF4QGIAG4R5LJRK4PBB3Q5F4XQ2A,True,2,Color: Sky BlueSet: Without AppleCare+
R2AOOZXA7B65DZ,B08PZJN7BD,"3.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly Unimpressed, AirPods 3 sound just a good.",Charles,3,"Let me start by saying I'm not an audiophile. Just an average everyday Joe. Amazon had the Max on sale for $429 on Black Friday so I decided to give it a try. On first use I found the sound to be unexpected. I thought it might be the fact I was playing AAC music from the local library on my iPhone so I gave Apple Music a try searching for songs that would push the Max. Some songs sounded very good and some while clear and sharp where still unimpressive. So source of music will definitely matters.I continued to use the Max for a few weeks until I found a deal on the AirPods 3. Once I compared the two I knew the Max was going back.What's wrong with the Max? First if the music is not recorded for DOLBY ATMOS, ie all of my music library it sounds terrible on the Max. I believe the reason is the Max creates a surround sound stage for everything which can not be adjusted or turned off by me to play in normal stereo. It further processes the music changing the audible levels of sounds and 3d positioning of sounds having significant change to the feel and impact. For example I used ""A New Hope and End Credits"" from the Star Wars Episode 3 sound track as one of my test songs it has a wide variety of instruments and stereo positioning of sounds. On the Max the song sounded very different in a bad way than on my iMac outputting to a pair of stereo Klipsh computer speakers. Instruments played on a surround sound stage making some sound very distant and some barely audible like the cymbal clashes and bass hits that make up the dramatic empire sequence starting around 6:30. I got a pair of AirPods 3 in December and they really put the Max to shame because they not only played music as I expected to hear it, it enhanced the bass and clarity of the sounds without changing the sound stage of audible levels.What did I like about the Max? Movies recorded in Dolby Atmos like Dune on HBO MAX really shined creating a very nice surround sound stage, good bass, sharp and clear vocals bringing a level of immersion I haven't had at home before. It's worth noting AirPods 3 did just as good of a job of creating the surround sound stage only loosing to the Max's deeper bass punch.Noise Isolation? This is not an issue for me. I have tried the Max's noise isolation and it works but it does not improve the sound quality. Maybe if I was in a noisy environment it would have been more valuable.Conclusion? I sent the Max back just before Christmas. I paid 3rd of the price for AirPods 3 which sound night a day better since 90% of the time I use them is to listen to pop rock. 10% I use to watch particular movies where I want an immersive experience, like Dune and Matrix Resurrections (paired with the new AppleTV 4K for spatial audio support); while the Max was definitely better bass in movies.. it wasn't bassy enough to justify it's high price tag.","Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2022",AHQ5QWUIO4EBL3DRHEQTRMH272NA,True,2,Color: Sky BlueSet: Without AppleCare+
R3RSX8MI88OZMV,B08PZJN7BD,5.0 out of 5 stars everything I hoped and more,TechFam,5,"My husband got me these as a surprise because I fell in love with the ones we got him and I've had them for a few months now. I absolutely love them.We both WFH in a 1 bedroom apartment so the ability to concentrate can be challenging at times. The noise cancellation on these works FAR better than the comparable Sony and Bose that we bought for him and tried first. Excellent for plane rides, can't recommend them enough.I was unsure how I would like the mesh headband area, but its actually very comfortable.The ear pieces sit gently area the ears and have a nice cushion to them for comfort. I love that if I sit them on the couch or table or desk, they go to sleep, and when I pick them up they turn back on and are ready without any effort. This feature is super handy for me.But that leads me to the downside of that feature....A thing I would love to see improved would be the case....I nearly always put it in backwards and can't plug them in if they aren't in the correct way. It could stand to be a little more user friendly. It's just sort of clunky. You really have to pay attention to put them away the right way. So at first I didn't put them away. If you don't put them away, every little bump or rattle wakes them up (great if its on purpose, annoying when its not) and will slowly drain the battery long term. Honestly if the case was something you could use without having to think about it, these would be perfect imho.Battery life is great. Even with forgetting to put them away and accidentally bumping them on a lot, it still takes a long time to drain the battery. They really last when you properly store them in the case between uses.And, the color is better in person.Really, these are my favorite. I even bought a cable to use these with my xbox controller when I'm not working but my hubby is on a zoom meeting with a client.

They made me feel as though I were child sized. If you are petite I recommend trying these on at the Apple store before buying.There is heavy pressure from the ear cups mashing against my ears and glasses and headphones. I can take it for about 2 hours. I was hoping to wear them much longer.They sound amazing when they have something with amazing sound quality to play. When I'm in conference calls it sounds the same as anything. I wouldn’t recommend them for folks that aren’t listening to high quality audio on a daily basis.I am very surprised by how well the noise canceling works.The case, I don’t have to say much. If you’ve seen it you already know.The price is high.Net: this was not a good purchase for me.My partner has a pair of these and he loves them. He has normal sized ears and a larger skull and he has no comfort issues. He even spent the extra $40 for the cable that allows him to use these with his Xbox and he's been loving that experience. So for some folks I think this is probably a great set of headphones.So consider what’s important for you for a moment or two before you add this to your cart.

RZ81PCWJUFGZI,B08PZJN7BD,3.0 out of 5 stars Mixed feelings,marvelfan,3,"I usually love Apple products and was on the fence about getting this after reading reviews but I decided to take the plunge and buy, when I did I couldn’t help but notice there were a few things wrong. when I put them on the first time. I noticed that one side of headphones worked well while the other side sounded really Tinny like I was listening through a metal can. The weight bugged me to no end. It felt like it was squeezing my head and made me paranoid. Like in a weird sense of claustrophobia even though I don’t have claustrophobia. I’m not usually that way with head phones. The next issue I had was lack of features. It had Off, Transparency, and noise cancellation. Rather than what other headphone or earbuds might have ( Off, Transparency, Adaptive, noise cancellation.) I was kind of expecting there would be different options of sound for the Air Pro Maxs for the price point.

I have had these for a month now, and super excited my them. Before I bought these, I bought the new Beats Studio Pro, but ended up returning those after a week and getting the Airpods Max. The reason on why I got the Beats originally is because the price of the Airpods scared me. But after returning the Beats and getting the Max, I'm happy that I spent the extra $200, because it is worth it. From the great sound and bass, to how comfortable they are, they are worth it. I'm an Apple guy, and got all of their products, and I use these everyday, either for music or personal calls. Some say that they are heavy on the head, but I don't feel any extra weight. They don't make my ear sweat like the Beats did, and the noise cancellation is amazing. Can't hear anything around me. Believe me, spend the extra $$$, and buy these.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2023",AHALTNPFO6KS4RCQVSRIJNV4VCPQ,True,7,Color: Sky BlueSet: Without AppleCare+

R2OENFAK3R8J8Q,B08PZJN7BD,5.0 out of 5 stars Phenomenal sound quality for music,Ford Black,5,"I thought I had been spoiled for the past year or so listening to music through my wired planar magnetic Audeze headphones with my dedictated SHIIT audio amplifier, and that the only thing better could be upgrading my equipment (I spent about $2000 on the headphones and amp which is relatively cheap for a planar magnetic setup). I purchased the Airpods Max as a wireless option to replace my Sony WH1000-XM3 headphones, as I have several Apple devices and the XM3's can only remember one device at a time. I also looked forward to the feature of being able to switch between Apple devices seamlessly.Surprisingly the Airpods Max sound significantly better than the wired Audeze, and a very noticeable improvement. I'm hearing instruments in tracks that I didn't know were there. Sounds are clearly separated with a nice wide sound stage. The bass sounds amazing which is rare for headphones. The headphones are so much lighter than the Audeze and I can walk around the house with them! When I take them off, my music or playing video will automatically pause, and resume when I put them back on! And I haven't yet explored the Surround Sound capability.The only negative is that these sound horrible for Zoom meetings. In this department the Sony XM3's have superior sound and microphone quality. Everything sounded metallic and screechy in the one Zoom meeting I tried with the Airpods (though it was worth it to show off my cool new headset!)Also I prefer the noise cancellation on the Sony's. Comparing the ""silencing"" capability with no music playing, the Sony's produce a pure quiet, while some odd static (like digital artifacts in the silencing algorithm) are audible on the Airpods. It doesn't make any noticeable difference when the music is playing, and here the sound quality of the Airpods completely blows away the Sony's.It is a little sad to see my expensive planar magnetic rig sitting on the desk no longer utilized, lonely for my ears...","Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2021",AHY5Z5PJ3MKCDE7VZER4O6EYYQSA,True,6,Color: Sky BlueSet: Without AppleCare+

I have never owned one where it has active noise cancelling or transparency mode. I have to say it’s amazing. The active noise cancelling is like putting in ear plugs it’s amazing. The headphones have spatial audio but to me it’s more of a gimmick. I would recommend these to anyone who loves apple and is part of the apple ecosystem if you are not in this ecosystem and use droid they’re still great headphones but not worth the price unless you also daily drive an iPhone. Very comfortable can wear these for hours without feeling fatigue or pain like other headphones. Not to mention they are so clean! Overall I give these a 4 out of 5 from an iPhone user.

R2F4JH6D7OXVYG,B08PZJN7BD,2.0 out of 5 stars WARNING,lynnex,2,"Buying Apple's AirPods Max secondhand (or ""renewed"") is a great idea in theory -- they're priced $200 too high, and that's from an Apple fan. So, saving money seems like a no-brainer.HOWEVER. The latest Apple devices have new security features, which includes all AirPods remaining tied to the AppleID of whoever registered them (even after a factory reset) UNLESS you remove them from ""Find My"" under your Apple ID. Whoever is in charge at the Amazon Warehouse is clearly not checking for this feature, as is the case with my order and why I returned them.When you're spending $300+ dollars, do you think it's wise to have your product tied to someone else's Apple ID? Knowing they could still technically find ""their"" headphones that you now own? And if you were to lose your ""new"" Airpods Max, you'd have no way to find them bc they're still ""PREVIOUSOWNER'S AIRPODS MAX"" (which you can't change until it's untied from the previous owner). What's more, unless you spend time going back and forth with Amazon BEFORE you order, there's no way to ensure the headphones are actually untied and ready to go, because Amazon Warehouse is not checking for anything past a default factory reset.And let's not even mention the nightmare of trying to return said headphones if you decide to be brave and purchase them anyway....like, really. Let's not.TLDR; If you're going to invest in these pricey headphones, buy them brand new OR make sure (I'm talking photographic evidence and possibly a written agreement) that they're ACTUALLY reset and ready to go.","Reviewed in the United States September 21, 2022",AGE3O5Q5X2GO43BFKQNSUK6EQWJQ,True,0,Color: Sky BlueSet: Without AppleCare+

I bought on sale with the fear I'd have to return them. Surprisingly, they are excellent; the sound, including bass response is rich and vibrant without the curse of booming bass. I wear hearing aids behind my ears and the cups fit over them very nicely, boosting the sound as needed with earpiece controls. They are also very attractive and fold into the included case for carrying. To nitpick: the ear cups could be a bit larger but suffice. An excellent product!","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AGOVEJJB6MHSPSQU6YHLLWXNB32Q,True,0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2UXJLAZR33T40,B0C8PR4W22,4.0 out of 5 stars Same Headphones for same price at Apple; Purchase AppleCare Plus for $29 from Apple,Amazon Customer,4,"I love my new Beats. I gave it four stars because I keep getting disconnected from my phone. I will update the rating if I figure out why and can correct the dropped calls. I will contact Apple support when I get a chance.This review is being written regarding AppleCare Plus. Huge suggestion: Buy AppleCare Plus directly from Apple for $29. Save yourself the hassle! Also, I recommend checking the price. I just purchase the Beats Studio Pro from Amazon for $179. Regular price was $349. Apple is also selling them for $179 as today, 6/16/24. I'm writing this long review I. Case it helps in regards to purchasing protection. I wanted to understand why AppleCare Plus was rate 4 stars instead of 5. I've had it and have it for several products and have always been highly satisfied. After reading nearly all of the 1-star reviews, the same message stood out- DO NOT PURCHASE APPLECARE PLUS FROM AMAZON. I decided to forgo reading the 5-star messages from approximately 64% of the customers, and just heed the message to purchase directly from Apple. Below is my experience in doing so. Again, to be fair, I cannot review the process for purchasing this plan through Amazon because I did not do so -I just wanted to avoid any hassle.I spoke with 3 different people from Apple's support team- one person via chat and two people on a phone call. All three people were extremely helpful, friendly, and made sure they did everything to help. It took nearly 45 minutes to purchase because the problem was my purchase date showed up as April 15, 2024 versus the true purchase date June 14th, 2024. The chat agency tried to change the date and it took down. Despite her efforts she was unable to change the date on her end so arrange to have someone call. A support person called, I missed the first call somehow,contacted the old chat message asking for a new call time. The support agent happened to called back anyways and the chat agent had also arranged a new call. So helpful on both ends. After speaking with the support person, he had to get additional help because again, the purchase date was not showing up. The last young lady I spoke to was able to work magic on her end and set it up where I was finally able to purchase AppleCare Plus for $29. I am highly satisfied with the support I received from Apple and I have peace of mind knowing my headphones are protected for 2 years! Next time, I will purchase products directly from Apple if the price is pretty much the same. This way, I can easily add AppleCare Plus! Had I checked before hand, I would have seen that Apple was offering the headphones for the exact same price as Amazon.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AEL3YFH2XJPGWP5J3F4I2KFB5KCA,True,0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Normally, I would not spend the money on these because they are expensive, but my husband bought these for me as a gift and they are the greatest gift ever. Use these normally when I go to the gym to tune out to any clinking weights and just so I can focus on my music or podcast. But the game changer is when I use these for daily chores while my kids are napping. I can still listen to music that I want, and listen to a podcast WHILE I am vacuuming and I don’t miss a thing. These are also great when my husband gets home from work and I’m trying to put dinner together together. I put these on and I can tune out the noise and the kids so I don’t go insane. The noise canceling on these is perfect.

First of all the great premium package, and the bag they bring is great. I have NEVER worn a headphone that has this sound quality, i was amazed the first time i tried them. SOUND IS CLEAR on the iPhone is everything so smooth, has automatic sync, has spatial audio, basically is a surround sound on your ears. Amazing technology for the price. My family once they tried them their reaction was priceless.So yes would i spend 400$ for this or more, definitely yes, it's a win win!, will update as i need to try them at the gym, but I'm sure they will be to notch with the ANC they transport me to pleasant land.

They are beautiful they look great. Comfort is about an 8 out of ten but I can hardly hear because the volume is very low. Am I missing something? Maybe I’m doing something wrong but if it is what it is than it is not very trustworthy to sell a product that doesn’t do the most important thing it was created to do. Besides the fact that I have to sit in a quiet room to actually hear on them. Is that part was different this product would get a definite 10/10 from me because the sound is crisp. The all around quality of the product is very high all the way down to the box and zipper bag it came in. The texture of them is so comforting I love it but I am definitely conflicted*update-It did get better after I plugged it into my device. Pairs easily with all my devices flawlessly.

My wife also works from home and we have two teenagers that are either playing or bickering constantly. Putting on these headphones with white noise, jazz, or some other style of music allow me to completely detach from whats taking place at home and focus on my work at hand. Also, I can participate in conference calls and video chats with ease and without interruptions. When I need to practice (I am also a musician) I plug in the cord (included) to my Nord Stage 3 88 keyboard (essentially an electronic piano), and I am still oblivious to what's happening around me.

I'd like the highest level of noise cancelation to be better. I can still hear my kids when it's on, not as well as when it's off but I expected it to be better because of the price. But I enjoy there are different setting so I can hear all background noise if I need to. Sound quality is good for me. These are lacking on bass I enjoy some bass in my music so these really didn't meet that expectation. They are a bit tight like other people have said people with a larger head or ears might find them uncomfortable but I have smaller ears and head so it's good for me. The padding around the ear piece is very soft and comfortable. The padding on the head band is giving anti slip vibes but being anti slip it does pull hair a bit but it is soft and I don't feel like they are going to slide off my head if I'm moveing around. I haven't taken a phone call with them yet. Connecting to my android was extremely simple. Overall a good value for the price especially since I bought mine on sale but if you are looking for something that drowns out the entire world when you want a moment of peace maybe go with different headphones. If you don't mind hearing some noise all the time and just wanna drown out smaller back ground noise, have a small head/ears, enjoy a little less bass then these are great for the price.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AHGBWUQCNMQ2NZBJ4ZPFFNHVNCTQ,True,1,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Bluetooth works well but will randomly switch to my iphone handset when on a call. Left earcup clicks when my jaw moves like when chewing or talking, have to make slight adjustments to where that ear cup is on my head to resolve the clicking when it happens. It is a physical issue with where the ear cup meets the band, I assume at the pivot point, causing the clicking that I’ve read many others have experienced as well. Disappointing for the price and being an Apple product but overall still decent and much cheaper than airpod max’s if you want a set of affordable over the ear headphones that play well with iOS.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHLXPJMU2VWR7M4WSMJ7P373EOJQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

The cushioning is a very high grade plastic which is comfortable when the headphones are being worn for hours at a time and they are secure. I wear eyeglasses and I use these headphone when I am on my laptop watching a movie or videos on Youtube. The area where the eyeglass arm rests does not hurt but my ears will get warm and I take the headphones off for a few minutes to let the air circulate at the ears to cool down, this for my use is the only negative. Otherwise these are a nice upgrade to the $60.00 or less headphones. I was able to use bluetooth to connect to my Apple devices. However, I have encountered a snag to be able to connect to my Samsung tv that is connected to a wireless soundbar which I am still investigating. In the meantime I am enjoying and glad I purchased these Beats headphone and they were marked down making them a good deal. I would recommend and give as a gift. There is a lighter weight more recent version of these Beats at a lower price.

Also, when trying to connect these to the PS5, PlayStation wireless bluetooth functionality seems to only be limited to their only products. And sadly not third parties accessories.

The noise cancelling still lets sound in when nothing is playing from them, but when something is playing you can't really hear anything outside unless it's super noisy. Off makes it be just like a regular pair of headphones, and transparency is actually pretty amazing- put them on, nothing playing, and in this mode you can hear everything almost as perfectly as if you didn't have them on.

R3TA8D15SL67IS,B0C8PR4W22,3.0 out of 5 stars ANC features are not good,Marine Petrosyan,3,"I was looking for an affordable option, and by the time I was purchasing this, it was 50% off, so can't complain about the VFM, however... My priority was noise-cancelling, as I am sensitive to all types of unwanted sounds, like someone talking on the phone at the office, or construction noises in the building, etc. I have had Sony, and I had no problem with noise cancellation. It was super cool, I could just turn off my nerves and work, live, move, do sports, etc. Beats has waaaay worse noise-cancellation, in the background in all modes I still hear what is going on around.The only things that is better comparing to Sony, is the stronger construction, for gym it is a plus.All other options Beats is worse. Sony is a winner.It is also a discomfort while switching between connected devices, take several some time till the headphone understands that it has to play on another device.Anyway, if I had to buy this at its original price, I would not do that. Not worth it.If I was an iPhone user, I would take AirPods Max, if no compatibility issue, I would still take it.So, if ANC is important for you, here is the list of winners:1. Apple AirPods Max2. Sony / Bose3. Beats (but not with the full original price)","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2024",AEENT7LBNMLBL4J246VXZ4AJKUFA,True,0,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R3PKX54VHP9QXO,B0C8PR4W22,4.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones,margaret juarez,4,"I haven’t own a pair of headphones this is my first pair so my review may be biased on the quality of the headphones from sound to design but I have asked people around that have own many pairs of headphones for their opinion about this set and I will be incorporating their opinion on the sound.These headphones sound very good for its price, I was looking for something that wouldn’t break the bank (I’m a broke college student), have good sound quality, and noise cancellation. I wanted something to block out the little noises and hustle and bustle when I study in the library, in a coffee shop, at home, or outside. I read a lot of reviews from different sites and watched videos about the beast pro before I committed to them. What was important for me besides the sound quality was how good the noise canceling was. Many said that for the price it was a good head set for its quality, it was equal to the the quiet comfort 45 Bose headphones.Now the sound quality in my opinion is good, I will say though that for classical and R&B music it doesn’t give it justice. You can hear the music just fine but when you are in a noisy environment, even with noise cancellation, you have to put up the volume to hear lower and softer melodies. For more up beat music the music sounds better especially like pop, rap, country, etc. There isn’t a lot of base but you can control it’s sound, you just have to have the iPhone 11 or 12 and up to do that, I have an SE 2nd gen.The opinion that I have asked of others are an overall 7/10The battery life is amazing, it last for long periods of time, for 10 hrs of music straight the battery holds to a good percentage. If I hear for a few hrs of music a day for a week, I don’t have to charge it until the next week. And it charges so quickly too, it takes up to 30 min to charge full.I like how it have its own pouch to store it in with its adapters and charger, and have an extra zipper pocket to store in anything extra.Overall these a pretty good headphones if you don’t want to spend over $300 for a pair.","Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2024",AFJACG5ME2ZWJUUIUIXBOYBEYPKQ,True,6,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

It stated the box might have some damage but the headphones were brand new. When they arrived I was pleasantly surprised to see everything was in great shape. I've only had the opportunity to use them 1 day but so far I am very pleased! The sound is great, the integration with my iphone is great!

I have 7-year old Bose headphones which have this base level much lower. The other problem is that Bluetooth connection occasionally breaks, which is a big problem when you watch a movie at night and suddenly the device speakers start playing instead of the headphones. Not comfortable on the head- after 30 minutes I want removing them to have some rest. The spec says that they can connect to many devices. Kind of true, but not what I expect. My old Bose headphones switch connections automatically. With this headphones I need to go to the device settings and manually select “connect” in the Bluetooth menu.Definitely not worth full price of $350. I for it at a 50% discount and this is max that I would pay for them. I was thinking to return, but finally decide to keep. They are not great, but OK, especially because I got them for half price (and now I understand why they are discounted).The best thing about them is that I got 6 month Apple Music for free ($60 value).","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024",AEE3DHH5SWN45RGDQX5AJIQTUUMA,True,0,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I also saw people complaining that it was hard to tell which setting you are on, but the sounds are very different for each so if you just quickly memorize which is associated with the appropriate setting, it's really not hard at all to know which one you are on based on the sound.

R3Q0KCRF9CILPE,B0C8PR4W22,5.0 out of 5 stars My first high end pair of headphones and they're amazing,Lisa Smith,5,"Not only have I never owned headphones that cost more than $15, ive never owned wireless headphones nor the kind that go over your head....so I may be biased with my review having no experience with any other headphones on the level of the Beats Studio Pro. They are amazing, and totally surpassed my expectations.The reason I used to only buy ear buds (the kind that have those rubber peices that go deep into your ear) was because I thought that was the only way to get good quality sound and lots of base. I like to dance to fast paced pop music and sweat to the oldies and have my music LOUD. I always assumed ear muff type of headphones would make most of the music/volume escape around the sides. But I was so wrong, these Beats headphones make it sound like you're at the club, or like the music is being performed in the room with you...I heard things in my music that I've never heard before; a subtle drum or base in the background that I didn't know was there, a background singer adding a note at a certain point...And yet it didn't change the song but enhanced it. I didn't know music could sound like this! I'm 32 and kicking myself for not investing in a nice pair of headphones all these years. I dont see how it could get better than this. If you love music, like really love listening to music, you need to have these! Oh, and the 'transparency mode' blew my mind. It actually works and I have no idea how. Charge lasts for weeks (listening to music about an hour or 2 a day). I guess the only downfall is keeping them clean, though I'm sure there's a product out there for that.","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2024",AFQHYSP2HWNWRTFYZ25WP2SFJ3FA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Noise cancellation is so good that it's almost too good. I'm a Mom who needs to hear what her kids are up to around the house. My solution is to move one speaker off my ear. The spatial surround sound is a good feature, but also a little disorienting. The construction of the over-ear speakers causes my hair to get caught in the seam!!!!! Yikes!!!! No!!!! If I had to do this again, I'd go with a less expensive brand with no seams on the earpieces.","Reviewed in the United States April 14, 2024",AER5XXYZFVMGQTLWGPRU4WMOLS5A,True,1,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

There is no way to adjust the size of the band so they slide down every 5 minutes and tug on my ears.Then, the Bluetooth connection started getting weird, and I have to mess with it when using my laptop.PROS: The sound itself is SUPER EXCELLENT! I rewatched ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"" with them, and there was an entire track of background noise that I never knew existed! It was a totally different movie with such great sound! The ear cups are soft and buttery, and feel nice against the skin. The noise cancelation works really good and it's nice to have the transparent option. It really holds a charge for DAYS!Basically, two problems, but I'm not saying they're not nice. They need to figure out how to fit different people better, and do something to make switching Bluetooth devices go smoother.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2024",AHFNH4FUB43J3NQYSJC6WU4MGWKA,True,2,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R1T7HWPFEWQG4F,B07YVYZ8T5,4.0 out of 5 stars Immersive Sound and Stylish Design: A Review of Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones,CMReviewer,4,"The Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are a fantastic choice for anyone seeking high-quality sound and convenient wireless connectivity. From their sleek design to their impressive battery life, these headphones have quickly become a favorite accessory in my daily life.One of the standout features of the Beats Solo3 headphones is their immersive sound quality. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music, podcasts, or audiobooks, the audio is crisp, clear, and full-bodied, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the listening experience.The wireless connectivity is another major selling point for these headphones. Thanks to the Apple W1 headphone chip and Class 1 Bluetooth technology, pairing the headphones with my devices is seamless and hassle-free. Plus, with up to 40 hours of listening time on a single charge, I never have to worry about running out of battery during long commutes or flights.However, it's important to note that the ear covers on the Beats Solo3 headphones may not fully cover the ears, which can cause discomfort for those with sensitive ears. As someone who prefers over-ear headphones for this reason, I did notice some discomfort after extended periods of use.Overall, despite this minor issue, the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are an excellent choice for anyone in search of stylish, high-quality headphones with impressive sound and wireless convenience. Just be mindful of the ear cover size if you have sensitive ears.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AHUPUXWKEITRCH5VBW4S7D33I7LA,True,0,Color: Rose GoldStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+
R1SLLOFV53BSY,B07YVYZ8T5,5.0 out of 5 stars Love these.,Bart,5,"I got my first pair in 2016 for free from Apple when I bought a computer with my student discount. I used them every day until sometime in 2023 when the overhead band snapped. So I bought these to replace them.I have a very small head and stretched earlobes. Most over ear head phones are way too big and fall off if I look down. Or they sit in a way that makes my plugs dig into the pressure point behind the ear lobe. These head phones do neither. They fit snug without hurting my hears, these are on ear not over the ear. They do start to ache if I wear them for several hours with my glasses on though, like if I’m on a flight for a long time. But I think that happens with most headphones.They have great base and are great for noise cancelling. They fully charge in about on hour. Maybe less.Definitely recommend if you’ve got a small head and shuffle to find headphones that stay on. If you’re a giant man with a giant head, don’t get these. They’ll be too small.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AFM3O6PY6AYDORNPO4BIMBHD4TYQ,True,0,Color: Rose GoldStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

I work in an office where everyone is on a call and talking, so noise canceling is something I look for in a pair of headphones. It more so muffles the external noises but that’s all. The fit is snug which is good for working out, and the adjustability is easy to figure out. The colors are a nice touch to the appearance, but the best part is the charging aspect. One charge is good for a week of consistent use. Plus it doesn’t take long to charge either, which is great for anyone in a rush","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2024",AEDGAFMHRDTDFKBHU5HFYTSNJRLA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

They hurt my ears if they’re on for a long period of time but that’s usually how it goes for headphones. I will say that one small complaint I have is that my hair keeps getting pulled out due to strands getting stuck in the opening on the sides so it results in me having to carefully pull them out or they’ll get pulled. Another small complaint is that people can hear the music you’re listening to if you have it on high volume, but I tend to listen to music on high volume so that could be a me issue. Other than that I’m satisfied with the headphones and the sound quality and price is very agreeable :)","Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2024",AHSBGKKIP4UDGIBF7Y7ROTSVKWBQ,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

Initial impressions before even putting them on was “Dang, these are expensive headphones,” and at $349.99, yes, they are. There’s hundreds of headphones on the market, many of them with noise cancelling, that are available for far less money. But, considering my first pair of ANC Headphones were the original Beats by Dr. Dre Studios, and adjusted for inflation since 2011, I paid $416 for those, these are certainly more than competitive. Also, there’s a reason that for the past several years, when people bring up noise cancelling headphones, they are usually talking about Sony or Bose as their reference point. They are quality. They do the job well. Let’s dive in.1. ANC2. Comfort3. Sound4. Build Quality5. Feature Set6. Who should buy these?Ok, so as I said, my previous ANC Headphones are the original Beats Studios, and my most recent over the ear headphones purchase was the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x back in 2017. I’ll be comparing these to my experience with the both of them. Maybe also in comparison to my gaming headset, the Razer Barracuda X.First off, the noise cancelling itself, since this lineup is called QUIETComfort. Pretty darn good. Honestly, I can’t say that it’s any better than my reference point of headphones from 2011, but still positive experience. Blocks out basically all voices (except the higher range like baby cries), and I couldn’t hear any other noise around me when in use. Can’t complain.Now for the QuietCOMFORT portion of the equation. Compared to both of my previous headphones, it’s a serious improvement. The Beats and Audio-Technica both were heavy over the top of my skull, creating discomfort over extensive sessions where I would shift the band forward and backward over my head to give a break to the affected area. My Razer Barracuda X are also lightweight, and up to this point were the most comfortable in this regards, but the Bose definitely have more padding on the band. That said, I still have experienced the same over the skull discomfort with these headphones, and the band has to be loosened to address it. Obviously, that means the headphones overall sit more loosely on my head and are less secure.The earcups have sufficient padding for my ears, and they don’t make contact, so though they are shallow, they aren’t as shallow as others I’ve owned where the speaker housings press against the outer cartilage of my ear. This, again makes for a comfortable experience over time. Like other headphones I’ve owned, definitely heat buildup inside the earcups, and these are no exception, with condensation gathering on the material. Yep, I was sweaty listening to these. But I live in the desert, so there’s that. Your experience may vary based on your location and if you run generally warm or not.The sound quality over playback is pleasant, and anything I’ve found unpleasant I can adjust easily with the Bose app to tune the EQ to my liking. I blame anything I haven’t liked to my various EQ settings (iOS, Spotify, Bose app combinations) and the source of the audio (Spotify streaming) more than the quality of the sound itself. Both my ATH-M50x and Barracuda X have mostly neutral sound, with the ATH being legitimate studio monitors being only slightly warm and the Barracuda having neutral with slight emphasis to bass for obvious reasons: gaming you want to hear footsteps, and higher bass emphasis aids immersion in game. Obviously, the Beats were very warm, and had bass emphasized beyond the Barracudas. So if I were to place the Bose in the comparison, I’d say its default sound is warm, not neutral, but definitely not as bass heavy as anything Beats put out in 2011 (and from what I read, remains bass heavy in the present). These aren’t studio monitors or reference headphones or audiophile headphones. They’re meant to just make your music sound good with little fuss, with the ability to tune to your liking. If you want audiophile headphones, neither Bose nor Sony nor Beats offerings in this segment meet that criteria. If you want bass heavy headphones, Bose, Sony, JBL have extensive options in that regards at several price points. As already stated, this meets the middle ground between neutral and bass emphasized. It’s warm out of the box, but not at the detriment of the rest of the range. Everything from low to high is clear and crisp. Nothing is overly harsh.Build quality is a little bit of a concern of mine. It’s very hard to find a set of headphones not made entirely out of plastic and no exception here. The inherent design of my OG Beats, though also loaded with plastic, felt sturdier, but the only moving points on those were the hinges, and to a far lesser degree, the cups moved on slight swivels to lay flat on your head. So it makes sense that they’d feel sturdy when there wasn’t a lot of pivot and rotation points. On these, the headphones have folding and rotating ear cups, and at all points across the build, there feels like there’s flex in it. I worry very much that my toddler or baby would get a hold of them and twist them to pieces. I don’t have that concern with either my Audio-Technica headphones, also mostly plastic, nor the Corsair gaming headset my toddler uses for his drum kit, which gets tossed around, stepped on, kicked around, and keeps on going just fine. But, as previously stated, the material choice keeps weight down, which keeps comfort high, like my Barracuda X. Both have lots of lightweight plastic. Both need to be kept away from kids that don’t know how to treat things with delicate touch. Though I know people do go for a run or workout with these, I wouldn’t recommend it. I don’t know if they’d survive a fall, and they’re not IPX rated anyhow against sweat or other moisture. Seriously, get some IPX rated headphones or use some earbuds for sweaty, motion filled sessions. Keep these for the office, study, travel, and everyday listening. With that said, these still feel like a premium product. They don’t feel cheap. I’m just leveling with anyone that is considering these of what their limitations may be.Feature set for these is quite extensive, and y’all can do your research on every last bit. Will just point out some things I was curious about when I purchased these.- The ANC has two presets: Quiet and Aware. You can craft your own presets in the app, and adjust them based on your liking and whether or not you think you’ll encounter wind. So far I find these basically pointless. I don't need to fine tune how much ANC I have. I either want to hear things, or don't.- The app also supports any firmware updates and allows you to tune your EQ to your liking. I can’t stand that there’s multiple Bose apps. I use one for these headphones and one for my Soundlink Flex. I really wish Bose would consolidate all their consumer, portable audio (meaning headphones, earbuds, and travel speakers) into one app. I don’t know why I need two apps for devices that both come and go with me. I’d be more forgiving of multiple apps along portable products versus home products (such as in-wall speakers and home theater speakers). It's especially confusing when the Soundlink Flex MAX is in the Bose Music app with the QuietComforts, but the Soundlink Flex is not. So weird, so pointless. Anyhow, I digress.- Like all QC lineups, these headphones also support analog playback over a traditional cable. They also all feature an asymmetric plug arrangement, 2.5mm on one end and 3.5mm on the other. Unlike the more expensive QuietComfort Ultras, this pair of headphones I’m reviewing allows for passive playback. If you run out of charge or are preserving charge, you can still use these without ANC and listen over the cable. And it has in-line mic as well. This gives you far more flexibility than the Ultras, and allows these headphones to serve double duty as an in-a-pinch gaming headset for an Xbox controller, and to continue to support phone calls, etc. through the in-line microphone even if you cannot or choose not to power them on. I cannot believe that Bose’s flagship product, the Ultras, do not offer that same versatility. This product would be even better if you could use these speakers powered but without ANC features (quiet or aware) enabled to conserve battery power, but retain the convenience of wireless.- Driver size is 35mm to the Ultras 40mm. My ATH-M50x, aptly named, are closer to 50mm drivers, and I believe the Barracuda X are 40mm or so. But the playback volume on the Bose seems louder and, obviously is more versatile than my analog only ATH-M50x comparison. The Barracuda, also wireless, are still less versatile in that they require the USB-C dongle or the analog cable to function, and lack ANC. Bluetooth 5+ is just far more versatile, even if it has latency that the aforementioned devices do not.- Main differences between these and the Ultras include the driver size (Ultra is larger), the amount of microphones used for ANC (the Ultra has more), the inclusion of Immersive Audio on the Ultras (like Spatial Audio on Apple… I’m honestly not sold by that at this time), battery life (these are longer than the Ultra), and the physical structure of them differ. These are just another rehash of the QC35, QC45 design, the Ultras are unique in their structure.They arrived at 60% charge and I listened to them for about 30 minutes before placing them on a USB-C charger. Within an hour I was at 100%. Could’ve been quicker. Idk. Was in the backyard playing with the kiddos and listening to the Bose Soundlink Flex (go buy one of those, I’d recommend that to anybody).So, who are these headphones for? A lot of people, but let’s face it, $349.99 will price out a lot of buyers. I’d recommend my existing ATH-M50x to people that want to spend under $200 and only care about reliable sound. I’d recommend Sony ULT ANC Headphones for people with $200 to spend that want ANC and plan on listening to Pop, Hip-Hop, EDM (their ANC is nearly as good as XM5, Sony’s competitor to these Bose… but they’re very bass heavy). I’d recommend Audio-Technica again to people with a budget of $100.These are a luxury product. I’m aware that there are headphones far more expensive than these. But these are still expensive to many people. At this price point, I’d expect no less than 5 years of usage, and as I’ve already stated, I’ve used $150 headphones for 7 years now. So with that said, a couple of points of advice to someone weighing investing into these:- These go on sale periodically down to $249.99. At that price, they’re still premium, but far more competitive against the likes of Sony XM5 and Apple AirPods Max.- Bose Refurbished is a great option. The warranty is exactly the same as the brand new product, and you save money. I’ve done just that with my Soundlink Flex and have been so happy. I’m doing it again with the QuietComfort Ultras, which I snagged at $259.99, instead of their new list price of $429.99.Okay, enough money talk. Back to who these are for. If you made it this far, the $249.99-$349.99 is obviously something you’re considering as a fair value.So with that said, if you are a professional or student that wants to block out the noise around you for hours on end so you can work, these are for you.If you use public transport and want headphones to help you escape the noise, these are for you. Just, uh, be aware of your surroundings. Ya know, be safe. Yadda yadda.If you want legendary ANC, comfort, sound quality as you go through the airport and on your plane, these are for you.If you want some good headphones for the gym, I’d say you won’t be disappointed, but I’d encourage you to do some research for other headphones before you make a plan to routinely sweat into or potentially toss about headphones that are not made for either.If you’re the type of parent that wants to spoil your kid with great headphones, I’d say keep looking unless you find your child as responsible and respectful as a grown adult. I would certainly have broken these as a kid, and maybe even as a teen out of negligence (i.e. tossing my loaded backpack around or something and accidentally smashing something inside or nearby, hard case or not). There are many great headphones out there for less money, and some that are more sturdy. If you want to bless your child that way, do some serious research first, amongst serious review websites that breakdown sound quality, build quality, etc.Wow, look at you! You made it through my Amazon novel! I mean review. Yeah, that's what I meant. Hope it gave you some things to think about as you find the perfect headphones for you. That Cypress Green sure looks good though, right? Ok, bye bye bye now.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AH5F7QHDE5VKRAMBN43A5WPU4ADQ,True,4,Color: Cypress Green

The headphones themselves are good quality and sound really good. I love that there is a ""quiet"" button that cancels the noise and an ""aware"" that lets you continue to hear your music and the outside world. What I am not happy with is that the second time I used the case the zipper split and it won't open and close. I contacted their customer service on Facebook because I heard this was the fastest route. They basically said, ""well we are out of those so click notify me and then you can order some."" When I replied to them and said they were brand new and I felt like they should supply a new case at their expense, they replied, ""I understand that I.., but at this time, I do not have an estimated date on when we are expecting the next shipment of the carry case. I do recommend you use the 'notify me' button on the product page as mentioned previously, and when they do come available, you can drop us a message here, and we will be happy to assist you. That was a month ago. It just feels like they should have put me on the list to get me a new case, not sit around waiting, jumping through hoops for a case. I also guess that I expected a quality case to match the quality headphones not a cheaply made one.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AGIAXN2CFOX4SNFHADHV4UAVPJQA,True,4,Color: White

I live near some warehouses that constantly have tractor trailers coming in and out and the noise cancellation has been a godsend for me. My current ones are getting old and looking their age so I decide to get a new one. These or even better than my old ones. They’re easy to use. I can actually set where I want the noise cancellation for different levels. Also, it’s very easy to answer my phone and talk to people while I’m listening to audiobooks. That was the only disadvantage to my old pair I could never get them to answer the phone. This one just does it with the flick of my finger on the little button on the one headphone. People say they are really expensive but to me you get what you pay for and I will gladly pay for these. My final thought is that I do not have to charge this one as often as I had to charge my old one.

There's always a comfort issue with me. I always had to buy aftermarket pads just to get the things comfortable because they always squish into on-ear headphones.The Bose headphones are the most comfy wireless headphones I've ever owned and it's not even close. The sound is fantastic too. I'm sure the Sony's are ""technically"" better or something, but what the heck is the damn point if I have to take breaks every 45 minutes to avoid a headache!Anyway, they sound great, they're very comfortable.I mostly use ""aware"" mode and it's miles better than the xm4's I used to own. I can actually hear my surroundings or if someone's trying to get my attention at work. Noise cancellation mode is pretty good too for things like yard work or whatever also.They were an impulse buy but I'm a huge fan now.I should also mention they're incredibly lightweight. REALLY good clamp without giving me a headache either. Also unlike the xm5, the build quality is great despite them feeling so lightweight - proving you don't need to sacrifice build quality for weight.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2024",AFLI56ABZB4GYAIB4NILQDVKDHCQ,True,4,Color: Black

Battery life seems pretty decent, although I tend to wear headphones in spurts, not all day long.I also like that you can use these as corded or wireless.Really, the only issue I had was that on the plane, I would occasionally get some interference; however, forwarding to the next track always fixed it.

It did take some getting used to the feature differences (buttons vs. swiping for volume, etc), but truly my ONLY complaint was that I had to purchase the 2 prong airline adapter separately (these used to be included with purchase, and my Sennheiser came with one, but it doesn't fit the Bose). I travel internationally, and some airlines still require the 2-prong adapter. I just purchased one separately. Unfortunately, learned the hard way though on a long international flight last year that the 2 prong adapter was still needed on some airlines (and that it was not included with purchase), and thus couldn't use these on the plane to watch movies.","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2024",AG62ZCV3I3AZNKIB7FD3ZYOHFOKQ,True,2,Color: Cypress Green

They said that they would send a new set, if I promised to return the old ones within 30 days.3 days later, the new set arrived! It was so easy! I put the old ones in the same box that the old ones came in, printed the label and shipped them off at the UPS store! I’m very happy with the process!Now I’m just waiting for confirmation that they received the package. Usually, as soon as it’s scanned in at the UPS store, you can see that it’s been confirmed, but I don’t see that yet and I shipped them last week.I certainly don’t want to be charged for the new ones too.","Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2024",AEHGPMCUYNQ3INAPECL6QLTPTDLA,True,1,Color: Moonstone Blue

Sound mapping is alright not a significant difference. Everything else is good, the app and the ui and accessibility. But they thing that's most annoying is multi device connectivity it tend to not remember the last device I was connected to and while im connected to two devices at a time it tend to have static noises. It has happen multiple time when I am work and ik its a small thing but it tend to get annoying over time. If you're connected to one device you will be just fine.

When you first turn it on you become painfully aware how loud the outside world is. After that you are able to listen to your selected audio in a new way whether that be music, games, tv, or even work meetings you are tuned in and dont miss a thing. You can quickly turn it off though with one push of a button on the headphones them selves which is cool. To take things further the EQ allows you to perfect that experiance by tuning to your preferance. The companion app isnt bad and does what it needs to do. These headphones do come with a hard case which is nice. I wear glasses and have been wearing them all day without issue or discomfort. All in all if you have the money for these go for it.

R1H5Z7FBRH92AQ,B00ODRSN0A,1.0 out of 5 stars UPDATE: The good and the mostly bad!,Stellar10,1,"***UPDATE***I have been utilizing these headphones now for work for the past 5 months. The good: is that initially they were sleek headphones, with a decent mic, and I was able to enjoy their use for about two months before the issues began. The bad: over the last few months my mic consistently has gotten worse. It would drop calls and the sound would go in and out. For a long time I thought it was my internet connection, but after troubleshooting and using my Bose headphones, I incidentally found that the dropped calls and sound issues were actually stemming from these headphones. Flash forward to today, I have been unable to get the mic to work at all. I have done multiple troubleshooting avenues, paired and unpaired Bluetooth connectivity, to no avail. They are now, after 5 months of use, sitting on my desk useless.**********************************Overall, the design and functionality of these headphones is great IF the mic worked.The Jabra Evolve Headset has both impressive features and a few drawbacks, making it a mixed but generally satisfying experience. Its small and sleek design is certainly a highlight, and the movable speaker mic adds a level of versatility that's appreciated. The ability to adjust the microphone's position easily is a practical touch for those who switch between calls and personal tasks frequently.However, there are a couple of issues to note. Occasionally, the headset has a tendency to drop calls, which can be frustrating, especially during important conversations or virtual meetings. Additionally, the call clarity isn't always perfect; there can be occasional audio glitches or inconsistencies that affect the overall listening experience.That being said, considering its price point, the Jabra Evolve Headset offers good value for money. It strikes a balance between functionality and affordability, making it suitable for everyday use, especially in a home office or remote work setup. While it has its quirks, it delivers on several key features and is generally satisfactory for those seeking a budget-friendly headset with decent performance.","Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2023",AF3SMZZTYA6U2IPUSHUXTWVIKZOQ,True,4,"Style: Teams CertifiedSize: Dual-ear, USB-A DongleSet: Charging Cord"

They connect seamlessly with my Dell Latitude and my iPhone. I love that they are wireless. It switches over to whichever device is making a sound. None of my teammates have ever complained about my sound/transmission quality. I have a noisy household with a baby and loud husband working from home so I think these pick up the right sounds. They’re comfortable with glasses on for a decent amount of time but I don’t wear them all day long. They don’t tug my hair when I pull them off. The microphone sits unobtrusively on the left and can be swiveled up and out of the way. The things that are not perfect are that it doesn’t alert me of low battery state. I think I can go about 2-3 days without charging (I have about 2-3 hour long calls a day) before I am surprised with them not turning on, but this is an estimate. so I’ll just have to optimize a charge routine for it like charge during my lunch hour until I have my next call every few days, or charge when I go offline before the weekend. I lose connection if I’m on the other side of the house. There’s no mute control on the headset so I have to unmute with my mouse. There’s supposed to be a red light that signals I’m busy but when I was on a call recently I noticed the red light was not on. My husband needs a pair and I’m not 100% sure if I would purchase these again, but there’s a medium probability if they’re below $80 and nothing else has better reviews.","Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2022",AGCIHTKTII2B6DTAQ45ZUKFJFQUQ,True,0,"Style: Teams CertifiedSize: Dual-ear, USB-A DongleSet: Charging Cord"

R26WSEPA2D3VE,B00ODRSN0A,2.0 out of 5 stars Headset breaks too easily,Isolde,2,"I purchased my first Jabra Evolve 65 for WFH in February 2020. Integration with Teams out of the box influenced my buying decision. I have since owned four Jabra 65s because the exceptional fragility of the rotating joint at the over-ear cup constantly breaks.The Bad:As mentioned, I hate the swivel design on the adjustable headband where it meets the round earpiece. Even gently putting down the headphones broke the connection, leaving the boom mic and headphone dangling supported by a single wire. What a terrible design. Evolve2s feature a different style with support earcups. I've never had as many headphones break from daily use as the 65s, and I am not rough. Even with great care, putting headphones back in their supplied soft case (dangerous in and of itself because you have to rotate them) or avoiding sudden movements, I've watched them break. For a $200 item, this is completely unacceptable.The Good:The 65s offer crystal-clear sound, very little static, and excellent volume control. Even in active meetings, I can hear all participants. Limited noise cancellation works well to diminish background noise for me. The mic filters out unwanted sound from lawnmowers, beggy cats, toddlers, and other everyday hazards brilliantly. Five stars for clarity and qualityThe Mid:Jabra offers a 1 year warranty on their workmanship. You can return broken headphones via the RMA process for a new set. I've used this twice now to replace two new broken headsets that lasted 8 and 5 months respectively.Jabra's Bluetooth hands-free or USB-plug in options are spotty, and I struggle to get the headset to negotiate between Teams meetings and regular sound (like Spotify) on my high-end laptop. Given these are advertised as Teams integrated, the integration does not work nearly as easily as suggested. USB wire-in is the only way to guarantee answering calls won't end up on mute. It does not transfer between devices well, either.","Reviewed in the United States September 18, 2023",AFKD6IIRG7SJSY2PLY4G6L7US4MA,True,0,"Style: Teams CertifiedSize: Dual-ear, USB-A DongleSet: Charging Cord"

It can sometimes experience difficulties switching between different bluetooth sources and I've had to rejoin it on multiple occasions due to that, but I chalk that up more to the flakiness of bluetooth.What I did not expect was that the headset would start coming apart in month five. The headset itself has a strange join where the slider for the earpieces are stored, with one end secured by screws and the other secured by a plastic tab. It seems that, over time, the simple act of wearing the headset puts enough stress on the plastic tab that the join pops open on the non-screwed end. I have included photos of this; both sides are identical so it is definitely a design flaw and not just a weak component.Making it worse is that while this is covered under the warranty, the replacement process involves being without the headset for up to four weeks with the turnaround time, which is pretty much unacceptable when you're using the headset on a daily basis. Oh, and that's not counting the near week of going in circles with Jabra customer service following several denials of warranty coverage despite providing proof of purchase and model number, along with photographs.Buyer beware.","Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2021",AETYWGVBYDV7CZACTAUXEEEOGHAA,True,7,"Style: Teams CertifiedSize: Dual-ear, USB-A DongleSet: Charging Cord"

Judging from the build quality and materials, you'd think this headset cost $15. The audio quality is lousy, max volume is pretty soft, and it's hard to hear well in even moderate environments. The device doesn't stay on my head properly, especially with the microphone down, and i'm constantly readjusting it. The ear pads don't feel good on my ears, and the band doesn't feel good on my head. Mic adjustments are cumbersome, and they don't keep firmly. There is no on-device navigation (e.g. back/forward/pause-toggle). Portability is poor, and when i do take the headset with me, i always feel like i'm going to break it. Maybe it's something to do with my head shape, or the way i have to adjust the microphone, but the magnetic mic stow is useless for me, and the mic sticks out like an antenna when i'm not using it. But that's rare: i always carry separate dedicated headphones with me, because i simply cannot use these for even basic audio when i'm not on a call.But people on the other end of my conversations are very happy. I work in cafes a few times per week, and other people in my meetings can't even tell. I had a meeting outside with a leaf blower operating nearby, and the other person had no idea, even after i mentioned it (even though i couldn't hear much of the conversation myself due to the terrible aural quality). I haven't had any other boom mics that worked so well.So, i'm keeping this headset. I loathe it (i seriously do), but i'm keeping it.Edit (2019-10):The earpiece is held on by a flimsy plastic shaft. This eventually snapped in two under normal use. Even realizing the poor general build quality, this component should have been affixed better.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2018",AGZVN6W3YSKJLIUFLWA2FE64KV2Q,True,3,"Style: Teams CertifiedSize: Dual-ear, USB-A DongleSet: Charging Cord"

You just slide the zip ties in for tight and out for loose.Now that I have that problem under control I like them very much. The battery runs for a long time and recharge time is well under an hour.

I use them often at home and the battery lasts so much I can probably count how many times I charged them because it’s so little. I bought other headphones because i accidentally brokemy JBl, still work but one side is hanging.

It was nicely boxed and came with a manual. Manual helped with knowing how to skip songs or play the previous song. Been owning this for almost a year now and it still works with great audio. Not long after receiving and using the headphones, I do and continue to hear low buzzing sounds when I’m not playing anything on the headphones while I have it on which was very annoying but I got used to it. The connectivity to my laptop can be wonky sometimes but I just gotta reset the connection when it doesn’t auto-connect. It’s pretty comfortable but does hurt my ears after hours of use.

It is a little to wide up top and the earmuffs don't fit as snug as they could. This causes some loss of sound which forces you to turn the volume up louder than you would like.• Great sounds for not having to use an equalize.• Earmuffs are hard, but will soften in time making them more comfortable on your ears. The material will puncture or rip easily. Overtime, become more comfortable with wearing glasses.•Easy control of the button functions/commands.• Mic is okay and callers sounds a little muffled. I definitely would have expected better from JBL in this area.• Very long battery life. It's been a 4 days shy of 1month and I haven't charged them yet.• Music and video sound quality are very good.

R1IVGTBWY7A3K4,B0CDH415QV,"5.0 out of 5 stars First Sennheiser purchase, highly impressed!",Shara Simpson,5,"I obsessively researched before buying these Sennheiser Momentum 4s. I had it narrowed down to Bose QC Ultras, Sony WH-1000XM5s, or these. Ultimately it came down to sound quality for me. The quality and clarity of any music genre I tested it with was far and away superior to Sony or Bose. These don't have the absolute best ANC compared to those, but it's still top tier. If you are looking for a fully immersive, lost in the music type of experience with your headphones, Sennheiser is the way to go. And the battery life is absolutely insane! I've had these for 3 weeks with almost daily use (at least an hour a day but usually more) and I haven't had to charge them at all since the first initial charge - they are still sitting at 40%! Sennheiser says they should last 60 hours with ANC at half volume and that seems accurate. No other headphones come close to that kind of battery life. I really love the Sennheiser app as well, it's packed full of useful features. The EQ on these is fully adjustable using the app. I used the ""My Sound Check"" feature and created sound profiles for various genres of music and places of use, but you can also manually adjust the 5-band EQ. You can save each sound profile and even use the Sound Zone feature to have the headphones automatically switch to a different sound profile based on your location (ex. gym settings versus work settings). There is also a Bass Boost toggle if you want head pounding bass. I really like the two-tone look of these - I got them in white, but the headband is covered in a very nice textured tan fabric and the earcups are tan as well. They are extremely comfortable for hours of use at a time. The case is super sturdy and nice. I put a size comparison pic in this review with the case next to my Kindle - the case is large since the headphones don't fold. This makes them less than ideal for use when traveling because they do take up a lot of space in your bag. The first week of use, I did have connection issues. They would randomly disconnect from whatever music streaming service I was using at the time and I would have to reconnect. Thankfully that went away and I haven't had any further connectivity problems. I don't use these for phone calls so can't review the mic or call quality yet. Overall I think I made the right choice with these, and am extremely happy with my purchase. I would recommend to anyone!","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AFPBVELJBKTT3FYLFSJ7RHINHVFA,True,3,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RQ0W5FUGCFR5X,B0CDH415QV,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, bad UX Design.",Cacho K,2,"The PXC-550 headphones were my go-to for the past three years, striking the perfect balance between quality sound and comfort, with just a couple of drawbacks: a lack of USB-C support and less-than-ideal battery life. Eager for an upgrade, I transitioned to their successor MOMENTUM, hoping for improvements. On paper, the new model seemed to promise just that—a better, more refined listening experience. However, while the upgrade delivered in some areas, it faltered in others, revealing design flaws that the PXC-550 had already mastered.On the plus side, the sound quality is exceptional, with noise cancellation that effectively silences the outside world, and a battery life that feels almost endless. These improvements alone make the headphones a significant leap forward.But not all changes are for the better. The new design is bulkier. More frustratingly, the intuitive fold-to-turn-off (and on) feature of the PXC-550 has been omitted. The satisfying click of the folding switch, which once brought a sudden moment of reassurance—a Deus ex Machina moment between you and this piece of machinery—is gone. Now, turning off the headphones requires holding down a button for an awkwardly long pause, a process that can accidentally trigger pairing mode instead of powering down. This seemingly small change significantly impacts the user experience, transforming seamless transitions into moments of annoyance.Imagine this: You're about to start your car journey, only to discover your headphones have remained on, constantly attempting to connect to your phone, disrupting the peace of your drive. Or picture yourself at your desk, a sudden visitor arrives, and you're caught in an awkward dance of trying to turn off your headphones, a delay that interrupts the flow of life.This shift from the elegantly simple act of folding your headphones to turn them off and on to a cumbersome, button-dependent process adds up, not just in seconds wasted but in the sheer inconvenience it represents, especially when you know how effortless it once was. The PXC-550 made life smoother, akin to having a trusted steed by your side in the relentless battle of daily existence—a companion so reliable, its absence is profoundly felt.In light of these experiences, one can't help but yearn for a simple solution: a PXC-550 reimagined with USB-C. Such a proposition seems a minor ask for the return of what was lost—the instant gratification and reassurance of effortlessly powering down by folding, a feature that made the PXC-550 an indispensable part of life's arsenal.One could say that the new headphones, while technologically superior, miss the mark on understanding the rhythm of life. The joy of technology is not just in its capability but in its ability to blend seamlessly into our lives, enhancing without complicating. The previous model understood this, becoming more than just a tool for listening—it was a companion in the epic battle of everyday life.As it stands, despite its technological strides, the newer model leaves something to be desired for those of us who cherish both the journey and the simplicity of interaction with our gadgets. In essence, the quest for improvement should not forsake the intuitive pleasures of the past.Btw 80 seconds a day with this button nonsense, equals to 8 hours a years of frustration.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AF3JMHEBBABMCAMCXQHQBEXC2ONQ,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3HDZ4YGKNQ6L5,B0CDH415QV,3.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable + Great Sound + Connection Problems + Poor touch controls,Ryan,3,"I just got these headphone. I really like how they feel and sound. The problem I have with these headphones is largely related to its bluetooth features and controls. I have these headphones connected to my phone and my TV. I live in an apartment. As such, these headphones constantly get confused between which bluetooth source to connect to. The result is choppy, broken audio or no audio at all and problems with touch controls.When its my phone's audio that's choppy the solution is to disconnect the tv using the headphone app. However, shortly after disconnecting the tv, the tv reconnects on its own and the problem returns. When its the TV audio that choppy, I have to turn off bluetooth on my phone completely to solve the problem. This again is due to the headphones automatically connecting to the unwanted source.The controls for this headphone are wonky to say the least and often don't work. For example, I will answer a phone call with a touch control but then can't end the phone call with a touch control. Another example is that I can't start or resume playing Spotify on my phone using touch controls. But while the music is playing I can pause, skip, or change the volume. I think some of these problems may be due to the headphones connecting to my tv at the same time. I suspect that my attempts to play or resume music are being sent to my TV (which is off) and not to my phone.The headphone's app is largely useless for attempting to solve these problems. The likely solution to all of these problems is to 'forget' my tv. Meaning, everytime I want to connect my headphones to my tv I would have to pair them with my tv. At this point, I'm likely to return these headphones due to all of these problems.To put all of the above in perspective. I have a pair of Pixel earbuds and I experience none of the above problems.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AF4KKUJCDDGW4ZZLQN23QJMOYFCQ,True,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones
R38QYC50V9S55Y,B0CDH415QV,5.0 out of 5 stars Winner of my search for headphones,Chip chipperson,5,"I wanted to find a really good set of over the ear headphones to use at the office and for general use. I tried a few other highly rated models at varying price points. The momentum 4 was the winner for me. I had been using Beats Studio noise canceling earbuds and before that a pair of beats special edition solos. The solos hurt my ears after 2 hours, while the earbuds were great, but they just don’t last long enough for my current work environment without having to charge. Additionally, the earbuds had bad sound wuality for the microphones so they weren’t ideal for phone and teams calls.I orders the sennheiser as my higher end option to evaluate. At first I was a little skeptical of they were going to be the ones. I found that just pairing them to my iPhone worked and was easy, but it did t allow me to use the sennheiser app. I cleared them from my phones Bluetooth lost and paired again using the app, and all was good. The app offers a pretty decent amount of customization and guides you through it. I think the app works well once you get it all configured correctly. There are other headphones on the market that will really rattle your head with bass such as the beats and some of the skullcandy headphones. I found that I don’t care for those headphones when I’m listening to podcasts or audiobooks, they are just too tuned for music with deep and solid bass. The momentum 4 delivers some very tight and punch bass. I can’t say I’m wow’d by the bass I get for every track I listen to, but when I get into a bass heavy track or album, I find myself completely wow’d by the performance and range of these momentum 4’s. I believe these are a truer representation of how most songs are actually recorded. The clarity, crisp, clean, tight, punchy, deep, and full sound from these headphones is fantastic. I think my podcasts sound great, music sounds awesome, across a very wide variety of genres. The clarity of my voice in a loud office setting to take phone calls and teams calls is great. The noise canceling is always on unless you adjust to transparency to some degree, and I would have expected this to hinder battery life, but these do a great job canceling ambient noise and fully live up to the claims of 60plus hours of use between charges.I wear these at a minimum 6 hours a day, sometimes as much as 10. They actually keep a connection far better than I expected. I have these paired to my work pc and my iPhone at the same time and can get up and move around our office and leave devices at my desk and never lose connection. While connected to two devices it does a good job seamlessly transitioning from one device to the other based on what apps or programs you are running.Last thing I can think to comment on are the headphone controls. The right earpiece is a touch sensitive pad that picks up on specific but very intuitive gestures. Pausing music, changing tracks, adjusting ANC and transparency, and volume is super easy. The only one of these I think is a little touchy is the volume control, which works fine but it seems a little inconsistent as to how much it adjusts each time. I’ve never had a situation where it was too sensitive and blasted me with sound unexpectedly.Overall, I do recommend these for the money. Like mine so well, I bought a pair for my wife as she was so impressed with mine as well.","Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2024",AEHRRPY3SLGEJSCWGWWY75QNAMUQ,True,6,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3CBBVTHO6OEW6,B0CDH415QV,3.0 out of 5 stars I wanted to love these...,Joe,3,"I own another pair of Sennheiser headphones, the 598SE's, and they're spectacular. They're spacious, clear, wonderful sound stage, light, and powerful.After trying a few other brands of ANC headphones, I learned about the Momentum 4's and immediately thought: OK, Sennheiser is gonna knock it out of the park.Unfortunately, they only got to first base.First, the good:I love how these look, especially the copper accented special edition's that I got. The fabric on the top of the headband makes it look classy.The sound is wonderful. Absolutely the best thing about this product. The sound stage compared to the other major competitors is still a step above.The carrying case is nice, roughly the same size as their competitors. I did wish it could have been a bit smaller (this goes for the competitors too).The swipe controls are the same as a major competitor, which you can also lock. I really like the swipe controls, though having physical buttons would be nice too, especially if you lock the swipe controls.The battery life is beyond spectacular. It destroys their competition and you could probably wear these for several days without needing a charge.Now, the bad:They're quite heavy. The weight on paper seems like they'd be fine, but while wearing them I quickly got fatigued and felt frustrated wearing them (while their competitors, it took much longer to get to that point).They get hot. Not the headset itself, but they form a seal on your head and you'll feel your ears cooking after a short while in a comfortable temperature room. This was another reason I frequently took them off.The earcups are small. They seem EVER SO SLIGHTLY larger than their competitors but... not enough. The 598SE's have big beautiful spacious earcups but these (and their competitors) are very cramped.The ANC is notably weaker in a perfect environment without noise playing than others. With others, I could barely make out any words while playing a song or video rather loud as a test. With the Sennheisers I could make out quite a bit of words and sound. The Momentum 4's have fewer ANC microphones than the competitors.The ANC also almost drops out completely if you have ""windy environment mode"" turned on, for some reason. (Note: I did not test them in a windy environment) If the ANC is important, make sure you have this setting *TURNED OFF* in the app.The app is ok, but what you can ""control"" seems finicky and sometimes its as if changing settings did nothing.The call volume is like 5 generations ago hands-free headset. Very poor quality. The person I tested them with said it sounded like I was outdoors or in a noisy environment when I was in a quiet room.The clamping is quite tight and becomes painful very quickly. It puts a lot of pressure around your ear which can become very uncomfortable. A friend said they loosen up after a couple days but mine stayed far too tight. It felt like a vice. [If it doesnt bother you, this could be a plus, as they seem like they will hold their shape and tightness for a long time]Even lacking almost any physical buttons, they basically threaten you to not get these wet. There is no waterproofing on these. Handle with care.The rest:These are by no means a ""bad"" set of wireless ANC cans, and the price is good, especially if you can get them on sale. If you're just going to be using them in the office or on a commute, they'll probably be fine, especially if you dont want to dole out extra cash for a minor upgrade in ANC. The middling ANC was quite disappointing, but if you have some sounds playing while its on, it works together to make most noises disappear. Unfortunately, sometimes I want to be able to just block out the world, and the Momentum 4's were just not up to the task compared to others.I was really hoping the earcups would be larger and more similar to other Sennheiser headsets I've tried/owned, but they seemed to want to copy the competition, which is a shame. If the cups were larger and the clamping a bit less harsh, I would have accepted their flaws and gone with these. With the laundry list of negatives, you can probably tell why I didnt.Also please note: I am a big guy, and I probably have a larger than average head. This could be contributing to the clamping pressure.Listening to anything on these was a treat. Everything sounded beautiful. Other brands should take a few notes on Sennheisers drivers.I had two main requirements: comfortable ear cups (failed) and long battery life for an upcoming flight (wow did these pass with not flying colors but to outerspace and back colors!). Unfortunately, as they were just not at all comfortable (I could wear my 598SE's for days and not even realize they're there). Their long battery life did not offset the negatives.This may all not be true for you. They definitely stand out and are far more attractive than the competition (at least, the special edition versions are). I am definitely biased towards Sennheiser as I have loved so many of their headsets, but found these disappointing in far too many areas. A few design tweaks could have made these one of the best over the ear cans on the market. As is, they're probably ranked 4th imho.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2023",AHECMYUWUWYVG4EVIGA4QI6LUO4A,True,6,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones

Safe to say, they aren't the most noise canceling headphones you can get. So when I went looking for a new pair of wireless over-ears, I had a lot to choose from. I didn’t want sony so that was out of the question.I had whittled it down to four pairs.AirPods MaxBose Quietcomfort UltraSennheiser Momentum 4’s andSonos Ace.Now each of these had their own strengths and weaknesses.AirPods Max are realistically only compatible with apple products and have the worst battery life. However have the same sound signature as my current AirPods.Bose Quietcomfort Ultra has the best noise canceling of the bunch, but was more expensive and ultimately poor battery life.Sonos Ace is the newest one of the bunch, it has decent audio quality and an okay battery. The worst was the microphone, I did not want to have to deal with a microphone that low quality.Which brings me to the ones I went with.Momentum 4 has some of the best soundstage I’ve heard in headphones. The bass is punchy but doesn’t muddy the rest of the track. The touch controls are personally a hit or miss, I love most of them but wish I could pinch or un-pinch to turn transparency fully on or off respectively. I haven’t charged them but once, and they currently have 70% after two days of use.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHMM6BNJ762VVIBOWD4MVGAQWYVA,True,1,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R1RV286N7J32C4,B0CDH415QV,4.0 out of 5 stars Sound quality is top notch. ANC is much better than my old Sony. Battery lasts forever.,B. Carter,4,"My daily drivers at home are open ear Hifiman. I don't think any bluetooth ANC headphones will ever match that experience, but Sennheiser comes closer than any I've yet heard. It meets my needs.The noise cancellation is much stronger than my old $120 Sony headphones, and the battery lasts roughly three times as long -- upwards of 60 hours. The audio pass-through feature is also great for those times when you need to listen to your surroundings.I enjoy the style as well. The white/beige color stands out among bluetooth headphones, I think.I've only two complaints: 1) My head is on the larger size, and these are a tight fit. They do break in after awhile (I'm posting this after around 9 months of use), but they still clamp a bit too hard for my liking, and can run hot. Should not be a problem for most people, I think. But for larger headed folks, be aware of what you're getting into. I'm willing to make the compromise for headphones of this quality, though. 2) the headphones have the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously, but I find this feature isn't worthwhile. When I'm listening to music through my tablet, and I get a text alert from my phone, there's a staticky sound that just makes it not worth using. That said, I haven't had the other software issues that some users experience. As far as I can tell, Sennheiser has patched it all up -- my experience has been smooth.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AH2PJ2BKE72VH5SVUL7TI6ZMXXXA,True,1,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

The picture shows comparison with sony 720n. I tried Sony ULT wear (too bassy), Beats Pro (too flat sound signature), Sennheiser Accentum (good but sound quality wasnt best), Sony WH 1000 XM4 (instrument separation wasnt bes). I have Airpods pro 2 but I also wanted a headset as the sound staging of headset is better.Let me address all the cons that you might have heard from youtube influencers. All the cons like headset automatically powering on while in case, auto pause not working etc are gone with latest software update (Software rev 2.13.28)Pros:The sound of Sennheiser momentum 4 is clean with impressive instrument separation and bass that both hits and resonates. The sound staging is shockingly well. For some tracks, it feels they are being played live in front of me. The sound is loud enough for me. I keep them around 70% as I dont want to miss out on all of that intstrument separation!the case, although bigger than sony ULT wear/1000xm4 and bose QC but its not as big as sony 1000 xm5 or other headset that dont fold. Refer to the pic. Because of impressive sound, I am willing to compromise a little on the case size.Impressive ANC. The world goes super quite. I cant hear my keystrokes when I am typing, no hum of AC in the background (my home office is very close to AC unit). Touch controls are bit sensitive but its not bad. You get used to it.I purchased them at $280. So its a steal. I would not buy them at $379. They dont feel premium enough to justify $379 price tag. They do live up to $280 price tag. Not super premium, but not cheap looking by any means.60 hours battery life!The clamping force isnt as tight as its on other Sennheiser headsets like 450 BT or Accentum. Its bit tighter as compared to Sony WH 720 n though. The earcups do seems to get a little hot after a while and I have to let heat out and adjust them a little.Cons:Not perfect for travel due to big case. But I still manage.Def less comfortable than my sony wh720nIf they go on sale for $279 or lower, get them!

R246JYYUL9YOYE,B0CDH415QV,"4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing battery life, sound quality, and ANC.",Joseph Oscar,4,"I've figured out the bug people seem to run into which is the headset does not output sound. They're onand connected but no music. In my case, it's when an app. is activated for VOIP. I'm currently using the Nextiva phone app to answer calls when I walk away from the desk and when I receive a phone call, I have to force close the app to get music rolling again. Once music is playing, I can open the app again to catch the next call. It's a buggy back and forth but I have it figured out at least. Current phone is Google Pixel 7 Pro. So if anyone else reads this, try force closing whatever secondary app you use for VOIP.I just wanted the main issue to be the first eye catcher but with the headphones working and the equalizer set from the app, these things rock. If I'm working on a car with the ANC turned on, I can barely hear the air compressor running in the background. A little but it's reduced significantly. Now the ear cup material will make you sweat if your in a warm environment so make sure your aware of that. It's not that bad really. I'm sure when it gets warmer out, it will be more noticable. Probably not a good workout headphone either. That I can't comment on. I have to many excuses to go to the gym 😅.Battery life is great. Rated 60+ hours and it definitely is there. I use my headset daily with ANC moving all over the place with whatever I'm doing and music running all kinds of volume levels. I definitely don't charge these very often but get over a week depending on usage. 4-8 hours a day thoughout the work week.Sometimes, the in ear sensor that tells when the headset is on will think I've removed the headset and turn off. I'll just have to push the right side head cup in and it will read again and turn back on. Kind of annoying but I think I need to reach out to Sennheiser about that.Fingure controls, super easy and very responsive. Once you've used the headphones a few times and read the instruction sticker that comes on the headphones, it's muscle memory from there. Your off doing your own thing swiping, pinching and pressing your fingers around using the functions.

RQIJ8796C2B2A,B0CDH415QV,4.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser Sound is top notch,NerdyCup,4,"TLDR; great sound with pretty good ANC.First, I'm not an audiophile. I appreciate music and sound more than just ""MOAR BASS"" but as to warmth, tonality, and terms like that, I'm lost. I do know having worn open back headphones those have a great sound space compared to closed back, but my wife can't stand hearing my music so it's closed back headphones for me.Positive:1. Great sound. Between these, some Senns 598s, true momentum earbuds, I've never not liked the sound Sennheiser produces. Earbuds were the weakest, but those were Momentum 2s and didn't last long when my dogs chewed on them (I understand Sennheiser has improved as well).1A. I cannot understate how good these sound - I literally can hear Chester Bennington pushing his breath out on ""Lost"", and instruments I've never picked up before. I can't recall other headsets doing that for me.2. Comfortable - immediately comfortable out of the box. Maybe warms up my ears a bit much, but the benefit is a solidly closed ""box"" for my ears to listen without distraction.3. Battery life appears to be as epic as they say it is. I haven't rocked it solid for 50+ hours to find out but I've charged it like once, when I first got it a few weeks ago (not constantly listening)Unknowns: need to test the ANC on an airplane/airport setting, which is my biggest pet peeve for noise environments. Will try to update (if I remember) once I do.Negatives:1. Touch controls in general. It's not just Sennheiser, but Sony and others im sure. I just don't really want to take the time to remember if it's a swipe, pinch, double-triple-quad tap to do something. KISS should be the rule of thumb. I can stumble through by tapping/swiping either side and eventually find something close to what I want, but I usually end up in the Sennheiser Smart Control App to make sure the ANC is what I want.Comparison:I also got a Sony WH-1000XM5 recently. Also a very good headphone, but the sound is absolutely not as good as Sennheiser. ANC is top of class though (although I also have t tried it in an airport/airplane, just in my commutes), and is better than Sennheiser, it's not as huge a gap as it used to be. We're comparing a Porsche and a BMW; should anyone turn either of them down? No.It comes down to your personal needs: lots of travel(air, train, whatever) in noisy environments? Maybe go with Sony, but I'd try the Sennheiser Momentum 4s first to see if their ANC works for you. IMO, the Sennheiser sound quality is much better than Sony's sound more than Sony's ANC is better than Sennheiser's.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024",AGX5BT3OBJ4RMSQM7TVVOBQTPU4Q,True,4,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones

R3V8FW19HBYSG7,B0CDH415QV,3.0 out of 5 stars Don't touch them or they'll try to connect to everything,Customer Since 1997,3,"These headphones must have some kind of tilt sensor or other mechanism to know when they have been moved. If I am not using them and I accidentally touch them or they get bumped and move even slightly, they will suddenly try to connect to every device they are paired with, cutting off the sound from a random device I'm not currently using them with. They also seem to just randomly connect themselves to any device that is playing audio, cutting off the sound so that I have to go to that Bluetooth device's settings and disconnect them to get sound back. Very annoying.That aside, these are what I would call 'average' headphones. They're your typical V-shaped consumer sound that you'd get from any other dynamic headphone. They're bass heavy because your average consumer equates more base with more quality.Their noise cancellation is not particularly good. They seem to slightly lower the volume of some noises. In the areas where other noise canceling headphones excel such as repetitive or droning noises, these headphones seem to not work at all. For example, when I'm a passenger in a car I can clearly hear the noise of the air conditioner with the noise cancellation maxed out.There's also a problem with the touch surface on the earcup. I have turned off the touch features several times but they keep turning themselves back on. Every time I touch my face to scratch an itch or brush my hair out of my face I hear a PLOK and a random setting on the headphones has changed itself as if I have interacted with them. I have to dig my phone out in the middle of my exercise, figure out which setting was changed, and change it back.That's not to say that these headphones are all bad: I have tried many of the headphones in the ""fancy wireless headphones with noise canceling"" category over the years, and I'd have to say that in terms of comfort, these are the best. I can wear them for hours while exercising with minimal discomfort.That said, they do have some rattling and creaking issues that I would not expect at this price point. There's an unusual amount of plastic material on these headphones that I would not expect on a premium noise canceling headphone. While other brands are using lovely brushed aluminum supports for the earcups, these headphones have stuck with the creaky plastic with clearly visible mold lines.To summarize, I would say that these headphones are sort of the odd person out: They do not excel at anything, but they are not particularly bad at anything, either. Senheiser seems to have targeted to produce a headphone that provides middle-of-the-road performance in all areas, and in that capacity they have succeeded.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AER3H6YXKFEFRVUVRRMSWOQFE42A,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

ANC is solid; no uncomfortable pressure or buzzing; and I took a flight while barely realizing we were on one.The folding and durability is nice and can easily carry these in a backpack with many other items. Extremely comfortable even for an 8hr session (and I wear glasses).I am far from an audiophile, but I have zero complaints about sound quality for calls, music, games, and movies. The in-app EQ is a good option. Mic quality is solid and have received zero complaints even on external customer calls.I was not expecting to like the touch controls. I do wish they were physical buttons, customizable, and on both earcups instead of just the right hand one. However, the actual experience (swipe up/down for volume, left/right for tracks, and tap to pause) is solid, with very few accidently presses. On-head detection worked perfectly. The physical button on the headset being a mute button while on a call is amazing, and this is detected in software on mobile (example being discord) and on desktop (WebEx mutes and unmutes itself in software when I press the button on the headset). This is amazing.The Multipoint connection (android phone and windows laptop) is very solid; notifications on the phone don't steal audio from a work call or vice versa. I do wish the headphone jack was a normal 3.5mm one instead of a smaller plug on the headset, then I wouldn't have to keep track of the adapter cord. Minor issue; very glad there is still a physical cable option along with the USB-C charging.Overall, this was the headset I was looking for and expect to run it for years.","Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2024",AHXNPP7TG2E73FWLT7L7PDVSH4XA,True,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

It's clear and full, but not overbearing once EQ'd down a couple dB in the app. What you give up for this is comfort and ANC quality. These are not the sort of headphones you forget that you're wearing. They definitely have some heft to them and a higher clamping force than others. They do feel solidly built though. The ANC works well but from other reviews I've read, it falls a bit short compared to Bose and Sony's offerings. It's a give and take, but the momentum's deliver on fantastic sound and industry leading battery life if that's what you're looking for.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024",AGE7TIJAE6AOGRW2PLXE2CTUAV3Q,True,2,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R11QF4OKPIM01C,B0CDH415QV,3.0 out of 5 stars Wait For The Next Version,J.C.,3,"The ANC was incredible, the battery life was amazing, everyone could hear my voice on calls, they were comfortable, connected over Bluetooth, USB-C, or 3.5mm for audio (with one mini end, which was kind of silly), and they came with a nice case.The construction felt decent enough to me, although, it is definitely not the metal build many come to expect from Sennheiser.Audio quality was a little muddy in my opinion, using it mostly to listen to synthwave music and watching Dolby ATMOS content via PLEX. The app certainly didn't let me dial things in, which may have been why things didn't sound amazing. Overall, it was just okay.So, what's not great? The app on Android is awful, the headphones would sometimes cut out to a loud static, or pick up RF interference, and the touch controls are awful and easily activated by tilting your head. Also, there's no ""Lossless"" option for hi-res audio and you need a separate dongle to use on your PC (and still can't use it as a gaming headset without it stepping down to AM radio quality I/O).Once the new Bluetooth codec standards for lossless 16-bit / 44.1kHz come out, and once you can pair to networks and some of the new protocols coming out in the next few years, I would be curious to see if Sennheiser revises this and fixes the issues I've mentioned.It's very close, but it's just not worth the asking price. Maybe on a sale, or if you're okay with being limited by the codecs available.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AGX4NRDWLOEZF64P7JCMFL3CU5IQ,True,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R2DR9OKGN9HSJV,B0CDH415QV,3.0 out of 5 stars Wired Mode is sometimes totally bugged. Manufacturer defect.,Amazon Customer,3,"I got this pair about a month ago, and when i got it out of the box to explore the features, I noticed some serious issues; the bluetooth latency is terrible for gaming, and in wired mode (to reduce latency), sometimes the sound is ruined.I'm a gamer, and I like to play a lot of PUBG, so I need great sound, AND I need low sound latency, I noticed that in bluetooth mode, the latency is just too high. Like ~100 ms high. Maybe this can be improved to like 40 ms with the right bluetooth controller, but I really want ~5 ms.When I first got it, and I tried to use wired mode (and stumbled upon the 2.5mm jack, had to buy new cables. Wtf is wrong with you. >:C), the sound quality was trashed. I don't mean ""bad"" like some picky audiophile. I mean TRASHED. I can hardly describe how bad it is, it's like the volume is dropped by 30 db, and for some reason only a few narrow bands of frequency manage to make it through, making some noises come through orders of magnitude louder than others. It's just this unlistenable murky mess. No exaggerationThis problem persisted for like 3 days, and it all of a sudden went away for no reason. It worked just fine for a whole month, (and I adored the sound quality) and now the problem has come back for no reason. What the hell is this? I noticed that if I back out the jack on my DAC by ~1/16 inch, I get decent sound quality IN MONO. Unacceptable. Factory resetting the headphones did nothing. A firmware update did nothing. Restarting my computer? nothing. Shutting off all bluetooth? Nothing.The other features are fine. Maybe I felt like the bass was comparatively weak to my old bassy cans, but I got used to it.","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2024",AGGGNM37DWTLZE7UPYKWPFJCCBCQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

The headphones are comfortable to wear all day and I don't notice any problems with the clamping pressure or the weight of the headphones sitting on top of my head. The sound quality is great, if you take some time to fine tune the EQ settings. They are also aesthetically pleasing for what it's worth.Most of the problems seem to be software related. Bluetooth switching between phone and laptop is pretty ok but at least once per day my headphones will connect to my phone and I need to shut off the phone bluetooth to get audio from my laptop. Also, there is no ""regular"" mode for the ANC, meaning that you either get the amplified sound outside of the headphones, or can feel the ANC working. There needs to be a setting that turns both off and gives the regular amount of muffling over ear headphones would normally provide. I also despise the fact that I need to use the Sennheiser app on my phone to control EQ or amount of ANC, why not make a simple desktop app that can do the same?","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2024",AFKOEAETUFFKKOLH7WK5CIUZCF4A,True,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones
R3CYLDF6PLZCPT,B0CDH415QV,3.0 out of 5 stars Disappointment,art,3,"Bought this headset as a replacement for my old PXC550. I had a few Sennheiser headsets over the years, and this one is major disappointment. I bought it because PXC550 was aging and I always wanted to buy momentum, because it was considered higher product line.1. Design - it is step back from original Momentum. If I wanted Sony I could buy Sony. I bought this headset because I like the brand, but design...why not copy iPods? Dumb.2. Comfort- clamping action is much stronger then PXC550 or Sony XM5(tried in store). Pads relatively hard and ears sometimes do not fit well.3. Controls - BAD, really BAD, DID I mention that they are BAD? I am comparing them to old model of PXC550.On/OFF functionality - why not to keep same function when cups are flat headset is off when turned in listening position headset is ON. With this headset you never know if the are on or off. Reviewers say ""it is not a problem because headset has large battery life"" - this is most dumb excuse you can come up with.Tap to Play/Pause - some times it works some times it does does not. You never know what will happen, will play, will it stop, will it turn off ANC?Volume Up/Down- no audible feed back when you raising or lowering the volume using headset and no immediate reaction. Why not to keep same functionality as on older headsets each volume change would respond with the sound.ANC- What ANC? most reviewers say it is slightly worse then Sony ... they are lying it is pretty much worse then anything I had, including $30 Chinese junk. This gesture adjustment does not really work, double tap sometimes work some times does not. On maximum ANC I still hear voices and passing cars. However it does cancel the wind which is good.4. Sound - Ok sound is not really bad. It is well balanced and has just a few more details then other headsets I tried Not within same price range, but within same consumer class I could hear background singer on one of the songs. It is louder then PXC550 which is good, but balance and detail is pretty much the same. This headset has no Stage at all. Sound lucking ""WOW"" feeling, it is pretty flat.I noticed this headsets has random disconnects. not really bad, but still worth to mention.I am still thinking about returning it, or keep it for few more days to see if they grow on me.I would say price (250) is pretty good for what you get.if you never had anything better it would be good headset for the money.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2024",AGFPE3TGGCHH7S4DE5Z7HZ7ZCAUA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

First the anc may as well not exist as it blocks nothing even when set to max or adaptive, can still hear everything as if its right next to me. Second the sound quality sounds... not sure how to describe it but maybe muddy or sounding like you're listening through a barrier. The headphones also struggle to handle intense songs like edm without distorting any voices while there is any bass and almost vibrates the voice causing it to sound off (ive tested tons of eq settings). Using them wired doesn't seem to fix the quality issue either. The bass itself is fine though once adjusted depending on the song speed. The touch controls turn back on every time you turn these off even when set to off on every device you have it connected to. Comfort wise they do start to bend and hurt your ears after a while requiring constant adjusting. Overall I'm pretty disappointed for something in the $300+ range as they sound like other $100 headphones.

R30434Q2LI61Q,B0CDH415QV,"5.0 out of 5 stars great sound, cancellation and battery but . . .",mike,5,"I decided on these because of the reviews. And price was right for me.Here is my honest opinion. Sound is awesome, and noise cancelling is good. The special features (like headphone turn off and on as you take them off and on. Side ear swipe controls and sennheiser app for more controls) Well . . . if they work . . . it is very nice. You can only run the app through your phone. So that is a drawback. I found the swipe controls don't hardly work unless you are using the app itself. So if I have music say on amazon music unlimited through my laptop none of the feature work well, or at all. If I am running my music through my phone and with the app the features work at first but the the longer I listen the less likely they are bound to work. Meaning the swipe controls for vol, skip song and tap on and off and turning on noise cancellations setting. I lose connection more then I should for no reason.Lets just say I have to go back to my phone app to turn on and off the feature to get them to work correctly way too much. So If you are OK with great sound and noise cancellation with a super long battery life and can put up with the flaws of the special features that you paid for, then buy these. They are very comfortable for me. Sound was too good to send them back though, just disappointed in the special features that sometimes work and sometimes not. (haven't used phone feature at all yet)update 06-16-24: So I now have had these about a year now. My opinion has changed and I thought I would update my review. I am old (62) so I still do a lot of listening through my MP3 players (I have several - not always listening through my phone). My biggest gripe when I got them was the controls and getting the touch features to work properly. Well, it may have been operator error and just getting used to the headphones. I don't seem to be having any trouble with any listening device anymore. When I take my headphones off my head they stop and when I put them back on they start. One thing that I had trouble with early on. I have had a chance to try out the phone features and sound since the purchase and it is pretty darn good. I can not compare to other competitors though, And I don't use that a lot.So sound is great, comfort is great, battery is great and features are now upgraded to great as wellI love em.

After these arrived, I did a direct comparison on these vs Sony’s XM5’s, with EQ to my liking and without (across several genres.) The M4’s even without any EQ adjustments beat my XM5’s with them. Man, these things sound great. Clear, precise, open sound. The treble is truly so much more detailed than on the XM5’s, and the midrange and bass feel balanced in more naturally. When I switched back to XM5’s to compare, I was actually shocked at just how much I felt like I was missing in comparison.Comfort:The XM5’s spoil you a bit with their insane plush earcups and super light weight, but I was expecting a bigger difference between those and the M4’s. For me, these are perfectly comfortable. XM5’s definitely win here, but the SQ on the M4’s more than makes up for that.Noise Cancelling:I’m not the person to give the best feedback on this, it’s the last thing I care about. However, If noise cancelling happens to be your main consideration, it’s XM5 here.Setup/connectivity:I was prepared for problems and inconveniences based on reviews and got none. Smooth experience for me so far.In summary, GREAT sound, and if that’s your biggest consideration, I don’t know if you’ll find better elsewhere in Bluetooth headphones anywhere close to this price point.

R2LOLFHZ6R8BHD,B0CDH415QV,5.0 out of 5 stars Sound great and usage is very streamlined,Henry,5,"I like how most Sennheiser headphones sound, and these are no exception. The app also lets you further tune the sound to your liking if you feel the need to, and if you don't want to play around with the EQ options, you can just use the ""sound personalization"" feature which is basically a quiz that will help create an optimal sound setting for you. The usage experience with these is the most streamlined I have had with any headphones so far. I use my headphones primarily with my PC, and with older headphones switching the connection from my PC to my phone was a pain, and because of that I rarely did it. With these, you have multi-point connection, which allows you to connect to 2 devices at once, and the headphones will switch between them based on which one is playing audio. That, combined with the auto on and off feature, means I can just pick these up off my desk and put them on, then use my PC and/or phone as needed without thinking about it, and then just plop them back on my desk when I'm done and they will shut down automatically. There are however a couple of things I can think of to complain about. Number one is I wish Sennheiser made a dedicated Windows app to change settings directly from a PC, but the multi-point connection means this isn't really a big deal anymore because they are always connected to my phone anyway if I want to change settings. Number 2, I would like to have some kind of audio queue when I reach the midpoint between transparency mode and ANC. As is, when you are using the touch controls to scroll between full ANC and full transparency mode, you get an audio queue when you reach either of those settings, but the midpoint where you have neither ANC nor transparency mode active isn't obvious unless you pull out the app and check where it is set. A small issue but it would further improve ease of use with these. Overall, I'm super happy with them.

If you listen to all three headphones in noise canceling mode with nothing playing, there is an advantage to the Bose and Sony. They absolutely have better noise canceling, but when listening to music or a movie it is much less noticeable.

I know it's slightly unfair to compare the Momentum 4 to this particularly Sony headphone but I didn't expect the Sony's to compare in terms of sound quality (they don't come close) or noise cancelling (the Sony's were pretty similar honestly... very good on both). But I did expect quality design and construction since it's virtually identical to higher priced Sony's. Bottom line: Sennheiser has quality construction and Sony doesn't. As soon as you pick up a pair of the Sony's, it's easy to tell that they are somewhat fragile. I even had a pretty good notion of where they would break... and I was right. The Sennheiser's are much more robust, and really feel like they can handle some tough use.I also found the app to be very intuitive and easy to use, unlike a few other reviewers... definitely easier than the Sony app.My only slight complaint is the touch sensitive control feature. It isn't ""bad"" but it does take a bit of practice.","Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2024",AGFKBQL6TWXLISK67N7TPEDORGPQ,True,0,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

So i am not pro in this, but i liked this ones so much, i decided to write a review.I want to start with cons, for me personally, it’s how they falling off when i am working out. Not to confuse you, they are comfortable and “steady” on the head, when you walk, or just laying on the couch. But when im working out it just feels like they are about to fall down my head. I am not sure if this is special problem of this headphones, or just general issue among all over-ear headphones.Except what written above, these headphones are perfect. Especially because of rich/balanced sound, and features in the app. Compared to meze 99 they sound more rich, and better overall, even though meze are wired. And app is on another level, even though i have iphone, its features are surprisingly wide-ranged. The case is alright, I did not use it that often.So i loved it, even though they are not that good for gym (airpods are better), sound made me keep them","Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2024",AGWBXITFMXYZD4FUV5P3LDV26ISA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

These might be the most perfect headphones I ever used and I am absolutely an authority when it comes to headphones, as I use them 5 hours a day and have bought every model on the market for 20+ years.The sound is so very clear and I hear frequencies I never heard before in all my old music. Blows away the HD600s. Incredible. Flawless. No other manufacturer can match this, definitely not Sony or even Bose. The closest are the Apple studio headphones but still not really by a very significant margin. Apple did make some very clever in ear wired headphones in 2010 that are fairly close but no longer manufacture those. Forget airpod prosThe ANC is the best I ever heard as well, too good actually I almost got hit by a car. It’s kind of unbelievableNo issues with the bluetooth and it connects to two devices at once without any issues, switching automatically as the sources produce sound. Flawless operation and the app is simple and well thought outThe build quality is perfect. Design is very stylish and classy. Touch sensor almost never goes off by accident. Premium materials, super light, very comfortable I even fell asleep wearing themThe battery (!!!!) lasts 60 hours at full volume and these things can be loud. 60 hours! and they charge in about 1 and a half.So, perfection. PERFECTION. These are the best I ever had. In fact these might be the best headphones in the history of the EarthUpdate: Ok they aren’t perfect. What appears to be a firmware bug disables the touch controls randomly and you need to restart the headphones to get them back. Well, whatever. Still 9.999/10Update 2: So the firmware has two major issues.1) You are forced to disable the head sensor because if you take off and then put back the headphones too quickly it disables the touch controls bc of a bug. Unfortunately this means they won’t auto off and your 60 hour battery runs down continuously even without use and might as well be a 10 hours. Facepalm.2) The ANC setting resets every time you recharge and can only be reset from the app. This is deliberate IMO so they force you to keep opening the app bc it’s spyware","Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2023",AGNTDROPGCQOTPJUEENZL7KDDR2Q,True,6,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

The only negative (if I'm being picky) would be that I've heard somewhat better noise canceling on other brands but in no way a deal breaker for me.My background is in mix engineering, thus making me hard to impress when it comes to audio products and I'm very happy with these headphones. The default eq curve sounds very pleasant with clean translation on all types of music. The low end is present without an unnatural boost, the mids are clean and defined, and the highs are crisp and silky without causing listening fatigue. The Soundstage is also wide with excellent separation.The app is intuitive with options for all aspects of the product. The only weird thing I've noticed is that boosting frequencies (such as highs or lows for example) using the eq has somewhat of a compression affect on the audio when pushed too heavily. Instead, cutting or lowering unwanted frequencies dials everything in like a champ.Overall I'm extremely satisfied. 👍","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2024",AFOM6TBSTO35DPNHEISJXHADKD3Q,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R36ZIV2E3IZWRL,B0CDH415QV,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite noise cancelling headphone,WT,5,"I recently added the Momentum 4 to my collection of noise cancelling headphones. The others I currently own are the Sennheiser PXC550, Technics EAH-F70N, Sony WH-1000XM4 and WH-1000XM5. I don't have any Bose headphones because I don't care for their sound signature. For noise cancellation, the Sony XM5 are the best, but only by a small margin over the XM4. However, the XM5's adaptive noise cancellation cannot be turned off and for some, this is a big negative. There are people who want maximum noise cancellation all the time. Not just when they are in very noisy conditions. The Momentum 4 also uses adaptive noise cancellation but unlike the XM5, it can be turned off.For maximum noise cancellation, I prefer the XM5. Especially for long flights. I also carry the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds for when I get tired of wearing headphones. In almost all other situations, I prefer the Momentum 4 and Momentum True Wireless 3 earbuds for their ""nearly as good"" noise cancellation and superior comfort and sound. I prefer the Sennheiser sound because I find the Sony to be too bright for long listening sessions. They can be fatiguing for me. The Sennheiser sounds more natural, and the sub-bass is really good for a headphone. I also find the Momentum 4 to be more comfortable than the XM5 especially if I wear them for more than an hour or so.Random thoughts:The XM5 is louder than the Momentum 4.The XM5 and Momentum 4 cases are not as compact as the XM4 and PXC550 respectively.The XM5 and Momentum 4 cases are the same shape, but the Momentum 4 case is slightly smaller.The Momentum 4 has thicker earpads and are more comfortable than the XM5.The Momentum 4 sub-bass will rattle your brain more than the XM5.The Momentum 4 has an automatic switch-on/off feature that can be somewhat annoying at times. It can also be switched on and off manually.The Momentum 4 battery life is super long.","Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2022",AHZKXYBFWRA53YQ6TPGOZN3DQQEA,True,5,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

But for $350+ headphones, I expected more from the audio quality.Am I accustomed to a standalone amp and wired closed-back headphones? Yes. Do I use wireless headphones otherwise? All the time (mostly buds). Do these senheisers blow me away? No.The details in the audio is very solid, but where it lacks is sheer power. Do I intend to blast my ears at full volume? Absolutely not, but with ALL my other wireless headphones, I'm usually floating around half volume, while with these, I'm always a click or two away from full volume, which is crazy... I'm only 35 and have near perfect hearing, so something with these just feels off, like something an update could rectify to unlock a bit more volume capacity. I've heard others trying 3rd party apps to increase volume, which does work, but I find that an annoying workaround.The noise canceling is almost non existent, which I read prior to buying but I was still surprised at their lack of noise canceling ability. Ambient noise is audible, and this is why the volume is an issue, it's a vicious cycle.The touch controls work well but can be a little finicky, especially the autopause feature which stops music upon removing the headphones from your head.Overall, good headphones, but not amazing for the price and those who like to hear their music in louder environments.","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2023",AEPQE6ZBDHU2PHPUNTN5CDBSPFNA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

Eager to experience a distinct sound quality, I spent several hours with the Momentum 4 and indeed found their sound to be uniquely different. Compared to my WH820NB, the detail was significantly richer; I could truly feel the presence of each instrument, offering an immersive experience. However, there was an aspect I found unacceptable—the vocals. The vocal reproduction was surprisingly lackluster, sounding flat and almost unnerving. The rich instrumentals and detail seemed to completely overshadow the vocals, resulting in a muffled vocal experience while listening to music. Of course, audio perception is subjective, but I genuinely felt that aside from the detail and presence, the WH820NB performed better in vocal reproduction.On the plus side, the Momentum 4 excels in comfort and battery life. I'm quite fond of the headphones' design—simple yet premium, with a tactile quality that feels far from plasticky. The battery's longevity and the rich EQ options available in the mobile app are commendable features. However, the Bluetooth performance is profoundly disappointing. Whenever the headphones are connected to both a phone and a computer, playback stutters unless one of the connections is turned off. At times, the Bluetooth connection drops out entirely, causing the app to crash upon each attempt to reconnect, necessitating a reset of the Bluetooth pairing. Whether this is a quality control issue or something else, I'm unsure. Moreover, the fact that a driver update takes an entire hour is almost inconceivable.","Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2023",AH6DM7JGA6NG7D6ZNASFJXSF7MHA,True,5,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

No joke, do not recommend giving them to young children as it could quite easily harm their hearing forever! Headphones are very well made and ooze good quality. Not keen on the carry pouch as opposed to the much nicer cases. But even the pouch is top quality materials and perfectly adequate for it job. I thoroughly recommend using the Skullcandy app to get the most out of your phone. Crusher EVO even comes with a built in tile tracker. Not sure why? Using a parametric equalizer is essential to get the most out of these VERY loud headphones. Its quality of sound is surprisingly good. But these are about bass, lots and lots of bass! There is a manual bass slider on the headphones and well places actual buttons for controlling your media. Comfort is not great. Ear wells are very small and the head cushion is not well designed and pressed down hard after a while. But, these are not something you will want to use for hours and hours. Because they are so powerful! It's really like being too close to the main speakers at a rock concert.....on your head! They don't use traditional drivers and as such can get more range without muddling the mids highs and lows. These are fun, not to be taken too seriously. If you like really punchy bass, read, BASS and have access to IEM'S or open backs, then get them. They are really fun! These are seriously powerful headphones and you only get one set of ears.

I've had this disease since I was 14 and took a ride in Todd Vann's 1991 Red CRX Si with two 12"" Fosgate Subwoofers. Fast forward 30 years and I'm addicted to it. As part of my research I bought the regular wireless Crushers. They are horrible. The bass isn't refined, the clarity is terrible and I returned them the same day I received them. The EVO's? Complete opposite. Perfect deep haptic bass. Clear mids and highs. So why did I decide to send them back? I found the Soundcore Life Q30's. Here's how I figured out which to keep. The EVO's beat anything that wraps your gourd in terms of bass. The SQ is good. The fit is a bit tight and the earcups don't leave much room for my ever growing 44 year old ears. That's actually a thing. You need to position your ears tucked up and into them. They are very comfortable, but a mm or two from being cramped. And yeah, tight on the head, good or bad. The app is fine, but it doesn't do much. The Tile is a gimmick. Who loses their $180 headphones? And why do cheap headsets come with hard cases, but Skullcandy gives you a bag? Stupid. You then have to spend another $15 to buy one on amazon. So would I grow tired of the haptic bass? Perhaps. I listened to them for a week, everyday, all day while I worked. I thought they were IT. Enter the Soundcore Life Q30's. Hard case? check. App? check. App that has noise machines and true adjustable frequency gains? yup. Comfort? 10x better than the EVO. Open earcups fit old man ears. Memory foam and not tight fitting make it like wearing a pillow. Sound Quality is very good. Better than the EVO. Has excellent bass. DOES NOT HAVE HAPTIC BASS. And that was almost a deal breaker for me. THAT HAPTIC is incredible. I'm going to miss it. Oh yeah, the Q30 also has ANC. And it's very good... some reviewers on YouTube say it's almost as good as Bose. I think the Crushers look better on your head. The Q30's have this wide look which is weird and maybe old school looking. Battery life is great on both. Better on the Q30, but they don't work as hard without haptic. End of the day I regret sending the EVO's back. But $180 vs $80... that's a lot of coin for tight headphones that don't have better overall SQ and no ANC. The perfect headphone would be the Q30, with the EVO's Haptic bass, and maybe a slightly improved look. Don't take this review as a knock on the EVO. I'll still probably own it someday.

I purchased them for $177 and would gladly have paid full price of $200. They are fun and do exactly what I want them to do: offer wireless convenience, easy to operate, and perform well.I'll start with what you want to hear, performance. Although I have not tested these against any other wireless headphones, I do know when I hear a really crappy pair, and these aren't crappy by any means. The bass slider on the left side sets these apart. Think of back in the day when Walkman's or personal stereos had the Tbass function, its like that except you can adjust it from awesome to completely insane (although insane is not necessary by any means). Skullcandy also offers an app where you can set a personal sound. Basically take a hearing test and it will adjust to you accordingly. I can tell a difference. Also, the crushers offer 3 listening modes through the app, music movies, and podcasts. All 3 work very well.These are not noise canceling but thats not necessarily a bad thing. Although at louder volumes (75% and higher) they block out a lot of noise, but I can still have my senses around me. At high levels you could call them noise canceling, just ask my wife!For being wireless they perform great. I owned a pair of urbanears and they would cut out and ""skip"" all the time.

This is day 3 and I'm on 74%. It came with an 80% charge out of the box and I didn't charge them any. I'd say I've used them for 5 to 6 hours already.These are really easy to use. They connect almost immediately to my Bluetooth when I push the power button. Probably the easiest Bluetooth connection I've ever experienced. On the left side is a power button and the bass slider. On the right side is a volume up, a pause in the middle, and volume up on the bottom. These will also allow you to skip forward and backward with a long press. Very easy to decipher what you are pushing.With all this said there are a few things I'd say to watch out for. The ear cups are over the ear but they are kind of small (and I don't have really big ears) and can feel cramped. After an hour or so I have to adjust and maybe even take a break. If had one reason for choosing another product over these it would be that they will not beat others in comfort. However they are not very large so you won't look like a space invader when you wear them. We already talked about noise canceling, but keep in mind if this is a must for you, you will not be completely happy with these.I love these but after I bought them I was second guessing myself thinking I didn't research good enough or could have found something better, and that may be true. But when I put on a song and push that bass slider slightly up and the bass rattles and it hits hard, I couldn't care if there were a better pair at the same price. These are super fun, different, not boring by any means. I listen to all types of music but these shine with hip-hop, and bands like twenty-one pilots, M83, and Foster the People for a few examples, but it all sounds good! Have fun these are awesome!","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2021",AHWW4NBQVUPQFFAIOI3UCOHEIASA,True,0,Color: True Black

R95ACV1HILSQX,B08FCGH2RL,5.0 out of 5 stars These are amazing!!!,D. Sadiqui,5,"I have had these headphones now for one day and I can't say enough about them. The sound is amazing, and the bass is head shaking full and rich! I thought the Apple Air Pod Pros were good and they really are not that good, they never were, and they are overpriced by over $150 or more.So, I ordered the Sony WH-1000XM4 thinking they would be really good, and I read all the reviews, so I took a chance. I spent $250 new. At first, they were good. But I was always feeling like I was missing something. I needed full bass. So, I searched for another replacement, and I came across these Skull Candy Crusher EVOs. When I first hooked up to the sound to my computer, I was blown away! It was night and day! The bass actually shakes your ears with full bass reflex and that is not even with the sound turned all the way up! They are a $120 cheaper than the Sony WH-1000M4 headphones also which are overpriced too for that matter! The battery life is excellent too. They are not tinny sounding at all either. The sound is full and rich! There are two different apps you can download to your phone for free.I would recommend these Skull Candy Crusher EVOs to anyone that wants full bass reflex for their music. They are not as good as a high-end car audio system but for headphones they are nothing short of mind blowing! I might buy another set just to be hooked up totally with great sound at work and home. I am a professional photographer by trade. Before that a master plumber. I am educated and I know great sound when I hear it. If you want really great bass and high-fidelity sound in general, you need not search any longer... these EVOs are what you want!!!

R1LFT35UUOUGAW,B08FCGH2RL,4.0 out of 5 stars So close to my personal perfect headphone. Unfortunately uncomfortable.,Corey Collins,4,"So let's get this out of the way, if you like bass to the point where you can make it ridiculously overbearing these are hard to beat. I've had the crusher wireless for several years and they're my go to headphones that I take to work, use when mowing the lawn so on and so forth.The EVO is superior in literally every way EXCEPT FOR COMFORT. The actual drivers product much more pleasing sound than the crusher wireless and the haptic drivers are significantly more powerful and faster than before allowing for truly teeth-rattling levels of bass if you should so choose. They have a slightly smaller form factor and can rotate flat allowing them to be stored in more ways and smaller spaces. An additional dedicated power button above the bass slider frees up the function of the play/pause button for an extra function. Battery life is nearly doubled as well.On to the one thing that has not improved, and is honestly worse off than the crusher wireless. Comfort. With all of the improvements made from the crusher wireless to the EVO the weight has increased significantly. This paired with the pitifully unsupportive cushioning of the silicone headband pad(which is the same on the crusher wireless as well, but they're much lighter so it's not noticeable) this pair of headphones can cause a sore spot on your head after a bit of time. The cushion appears deeper than the cushion on the crusher wireless however it feels just as thin so instead of actual padding it's more like an air pocket behind it and it basically just squishes flat offering no real support or relief. The pad is also significantly less wide than on the original crusher wireless decreasing the contact area and increasing how the weight of the headphones digs into that area.Even thought these headphones are much less comfortable than the original crusher wireless I've been using for years I still can't give them less than a 4/5 because I love everything about how they sound. I'm actively working on resolving the headband pad issue myself trying a couple of different methods, if I find a method that works well enough that I don't get a pressure point headache after about an hour I'll update my review and include pictures.EDIT:So after about 2.5 months of daily use, I can say I did get slightly accustomed to the fit and weight. I still wouldn't describe them as comfortable. I tried several aftermarket headband pad type products, even tried to make my own little suspension style strap with the headband screws(they're too close together, doesn't really work). I did find one thing that makes the headphones comfortable pretty much indefinitely for me at least. A structured, or at least semi-structured hat. I bought a Richardson style 112 hat, was wearing it while mowing the lawn, and had the headphones on over the hat(at nearly max extension so this may not work for people who already have the headphones passed the halfway mark) and when I finished mowing I realized my head wasn't hurting and I hadn't been pushing the headphones around. The structuring in the hat supports the weight of the headband and fixes my only issue for these headphones. I also made myself these little 3D printed adapters that slot into the groove the stock earpads fit on to allow for larger earpads, they fit MDR7506/M50X size pads now which isn't necessary but I think it's nice. I did however learn in doing this that you want standard thickness pads, not extra thick pads. They make the clamp force on your temples/jaw kind of painful and the increased airspace in there means you have to really crank the volume and may not be loud enough still. But overall the vibration effect wasn't that affected, maybe a little but I don't run it maxed out anyway so I had room to crank it up more.","Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2020",AGHD4ZN6SO6NXG675JMXODXVZZYQ,True,2,Color: True Black

The bass is very strong. Though the bass is so strong when the slider is all the way up, that it feels as if you are listening to the bass instead of feeling the bass (which I understand is just because the bass is just so good). The bass slider is very nice especially for people who listen to every genre some songs have higher bass like rap and you can turn it down for that. However some songs have lower bass and turning up the bass can be best for your listening experience.For example the bass shakes my table when all the way up playing the song kill shot by Eminem. So if you want bass like that these are definitely the headphones for you.How ever these headphones are kind of uncomfortable.

I use them all day on weekends and all evening on weekdays, and they still rarely run-out. This is in sharp contrast to my old Sony XM3's (charged every 1-2 days).2) Bass: The absolute bassiest! There are songs I'd gotten tired of listening to that I fell back in love with after discovering hidden bass that my other headphones couldn't bring out. It absolutely elevates almost any song.3) Quality: The quality is great. For those using these on a personal computer, I strongly recommend additionally using surround/spatial sound software like Doby Atmos. It somehow makes these even bassier, like a concert hall over your ears.4) Noise cancellation: This was initially my main gripe about these, they have no active noise cancellation. The passive one is decent, but definitely not the same. But if your music is on loud enough (in conjunction with bass), background sounds tend to be drowned-out.","Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2024",AGBT2BALU2UCAFDXNQR33BORJWHQ,True,1,Color: True Black

R38NNFOUBKJPC8,B08FCGH2RL,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great for Rock, pop and Hip Hop!",Mike L,5,"I bought these to replace an old set of Skullcandy wired Evos that had seen better days. I was amazed at the amount of bass these have while also offering decent high frequency response.I like bass heavy music from old school hiphop to electronic trance music to heavy metal and classic rock. These things will pound bass from any music and I usually only have the bass boost on maybe 10-15%. Anything more and it's overpowering. They sound very good and outperform my Beats Studio cans in every way. Battery life is amazing. I use them every night to watch Youtube or listen to music while I do housework and they've never gone dead on me. I'll charge them once a week just to make sure they're always ready, but I think they'd last weeks if I let them. I even forgot and took the trash cans to the curb one night and realized I still had them playing when they slightly buffered when I got to the street with them. I have a half acre and was a good 100 feet from my laptop with a garage and several cars in between. I can't get wifi out there, but my BT worked! My laptop likey has better range than my phone, but it was still impressive. The onboard controls work well too. I can adjust volume, pause play and skip tracks (skip by holding volume keys), even on YouTube. The adjustable bass boost allows you to go from nothing to nuclear, so they work great for many types of music as well as movies, TV or audiobooks.Now if you're a purist looking for a flat, balanced sound that catches every nuance of the orchestra, you probably want something else. If you want bass like those cars that rattle your windows when they drive by, you'll love these! They may also be good for dislodging any earwax buildup *This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA and is not intended to cure any disease!:-).Cons: the pads are a bit firm and the fit is tight. This is good for sealing purposes, but can be a bit uncomfortable after a long listening session. I have a big head, so if you're not a neanderthal like me, it may not be an issue for you. I can't say that the noise cancellation is as good or better than others I've tried. My wife blasts the TV and flat screen speakers sound like nails on a chalkboard to me. I watch my stuff on my laptop with my Evos on and can often hear the tv at an annoying level if I'm not cranking the cans. I think the harsh, tinny frequencies of the tv pass through the plastic cans too well. I really don't use NC stand alone, and can always overpower external noise, so it's not a big deal to me. For my purposes, I can't find anything better.","Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2021",AFY7ZR4E6TCTWQPBTUCF6VU3LDCQ,True,2,Color: True Black

Phones don't have headphone jacks anymore so that made my corded Skullcandy buds useless, and the bluetooth sets I've had have never impressed me. They always have connectivity issues, fall out of sync, or one of them won't charge in the case.I have cauliflower ear from wrestling which always made finding earbuds I liked tough, and I didn't want to spend the money on the moldable ones. I always thought people that wore these looked douchey, but I thew vanity away when I became a father.I love the sound quality, the fit is comfortable all day, the battery is astounding, and the bass is fantastic. I wear them while I mow grass, cut and split firewood, pull weeds and rototil in the garden, and they hold up to heat and cold great. The noise canceling is great even with a ball cap on.Here's the best thing. I left these things out by the wood pile for 11 days while I was on vacation, and it rained 8 of them. They may as well have been submerged the whole time. I took them in and put them in rice for 3 days, and they fired right up, sounded exactly the same, and still had 80% battery left.10/10 would recommend.","Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2023",AFMF77LDKZL7L32LPODQVCAT7WGQ,True,4,Color: True Black

R3QOUA84M5XJ4D,B08FCGH2RL,4.0 out of 5 stars The only headphones I've ever found with a lot of bass.,Amazon Customer,4,"For years I've been searching for headphones with a lot of bass and a lot of volume. I've gone through so many web searches for headphones with both, and I'm always disappointed with what I get. Finally I've come to this set. Now first off, I like my music louder and I like more bass than most people, I think. For what that's worth. I find these headphones... loud enough for sort-of loud listening for long periods. I'd like them to be louder, but if they were, they wouldn't really be safe for long-term listening. So they're adequate from that point of view. Now the bass, is where these really shine. I never thought I'd find headphones that had TOO MUCH bass, but these headphones can get there. These headphones produce surprisingly solid and deep bass. I thought the vibration effect was going to be a gimmick that I would just turn off, but unlike other Skullcandy earphones, this effect works. Even with the bass adjustment slider at only 20%, music has a very full, solid bottom end. When I do some rap with a lot of bass, I can turn the slider up more, and although it's nowhere near as loud, it's similar to being in a car with good subwoofers, just surrounding you with bass. Listening to rock and heavy metal, the drums and bass are much more full and really gives the music some body. I really wish I could get another, like 3 db out of these headphones, but so far they're pretty usable for listening to music all day long while I'm working. And if you like bass, trust me, these headphones are the only game in town. Don't even bother with anything else, it'll be crap.One year later: well my only quibble with these was that they didn't get really all that incredibly loud, however I discovered if you use the cord to plug directly into your phone, it actually bumps the volume up a fair bit. Plus, I've got a headphone amp now, and if I put that in line, it definitely gets loud enough even for me. And they take quite a bit of volume without distorting. Once again these headphones are my top recommendation.I'm adding another edit; after almost a year of use at work, when I'm constantly bumping them and banging them into things and dropping them, I have to say these have held up perfectly. The outsides are a little marred up, naturally, because of all the collisions and accidental rubs, but everything still works 100%.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2022",AFXKZUENNROL5PEHLWONJRGVJKPA,True,7,Color: True Black
R166DYME31U9TY,B08FCGH2RL,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing headphones at this price,Gil Selinger,5,"These are great headphones. As a professional musician, I am concered with hearing everything clearly. The fact that they test your hearing and adjust levels based on that is fantastic. The bass is a bit gimmicky but it is a super mega bass and you have a lever to turn it from off to way overboard full. Otherwise though the sound is punchy and balanced, espically impressive are the mids which usually get lost in less expensive headphones. The battery life is also insane, I've had these for 3 weeks and have been listening for a few hours every day and have yet to need to recharge the headphones. I still am at 35% after 22 days of listening, Incredible. I got these a flash sale a month ago for half price, so just a great deal. I've had other skull kandy earphones since I first discovered them about 12 years ago and they have always punched way above their price point.

I listen to them almost every night before bed, in the gym, and when I'm mowing or doing yard work and I think I charge them maybe once or 2 times a month.My only complaint is that I wish the volume would go a tad bit louder for mids and vocals, but for me they do 95% of what I want out of a pair of headphones.100% would buy again in a heartbeat.","Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2024",AHV6N4CJ4E6VIWLRE4OC3FSX6REQ,True,0,Color: True Black

R36HWGIAY6VK0Q,B08FCGH2RL,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats the old Crushers,ReluctantAmazonUser,5,"This review is mostly for people thinking about upgrading from the standard Crushers:I have a pair of last year's Crushers and they are my favorite headphones I've ever owned. Sound isn't audiophile accuracy, they are just loud banging fun. Needed another pair of headphones for work. Ordered a pair of Under Armour Project Rock over ear headphones because summer is about to get sweaty in my woodworking factory. Sent them back within a day. They didn't come close to the Crushers (undstatement. If you're considering those, just don't. Had all kinds of wack issues with them). Was about to just order a second pair of the my favorite eardrum destroyers when I saw the Evos. Pulled the trigger on these due to the physical pause button. I work in a stain booth so I can't easily take my whole headset off everytime someone needs me without getting stain all over them. With these I can wipe a finger off and quickly pause my music or podcast. Now $90 over the old Crushers for a single feature, that's also in place of what I really wanted (Skullcandy, please add talk thru), is pretty steep. I honestly didn't know if I would keep them after they arrived. Figured yeah if the audio and bass were improved significantly, but I didn't really have high hopes. My god was I mistaken. Everything sounds fuller with much more range, and the bass, while still exaggerated, has been noticably fine tuned. It's honestly an incredible experience. Never before have I let somebody listen to my headphones and watched their eyes light up, and it happens to literally every person I've let try them. And each of them asked for the name and said they wanted a set for themselves. Screw Beats. Screw Bose. Screw Project Rock (lol). Screw Apple. If you love banging music, this is where it's at. I'd say even if youre an audiophile, these should be in your inventory.Disclaimer: I am 33. Had subs in my car as a teen. Frequented loud shows through my 20s. I now have tinitus, constant ringing in my ears. Very quiet environments can be downright torturous. And I say ""huh?"" to people way more than any man should. I'm not your daddy, you live your life. Alls I'm saying is if you plan to crank these daily, expect the damage.","Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2022",AF2O3UZBNKA2GGICO4OFXWOSSWCQ,True,2,Color: True Black
R2YWNJ6U31BQSM,B08FCGH2RL,3.0 out of 5 stars Sad hollow sound; bass is delivered directly to the ears.,PAUL JAMES CHATMAN,3,"I really had high hopes for these headphones, and I really wanted to like them. But they are an audio disappointment. I see now why I always avoided open-air sets. The sound is hollow and sticks to my head. My Sony had the sound space extend beyond my head.These push the sound of music and sounds into my head, and sounds that should be far away into the background sound dull and washed out. It sounds hollow or like I'm in a box; intimate. The bass experience is weird. It literally just pushes against my ears, and does not seem to fill the headspace.Seeing as how these headphones are so popular, this design is intentional, because of the way they're constructed; the fact that they're open air, which is why I prefer closed air headphones. These seem to better built than ALL of my Sonys.I gave these a shot, but these are going to have to be returned and exchanged for better sounding, but poorly constructed, Sonys.

Although Skullcandy is a less popular brand of headphones than Beats and is cheaper the quality difference between the Skullcandy headphones and Beats Headphones is surprisingly much higher than what I had originally anticipated. One thing that I disliked about Beats headphones was that it felt like my ears were being squished after an hour of using them which was annoying because it would cause my ears to itch and hurt. But with the Skullcandy Evos, I can honestly wear them all day before it starts to hurt my ears which I’m fine with tbh. The Skullcandy Evos sound quality is also better especially if you add in the fact that you can adjust the bass to your liking, which is a nice feature.

As someone who has tested and used various headphones, I was intrigued to see how these would perform, and I was not disappointed.First off, the design of the headphones is sleek and stylish, with a comfortable fit that allows for extended listening sessions without any discomfort. The ear cups are well padded, and the adjustable headband ensures a secure and snug fit on your head.But the standout feature of these headphones is the haptic bass technology. It adds an extra dimension to the audio experience by creating a physical sensation that you can feel as well as hear. The bass is strong and punchy, making it perfect for bass-heavy music genres like hip-hop and EDM.The headphones also have excellent battery life, with up to 40 hours of playback time on a single charge. They also come with a handy carrying case for easy transport and storage.However, it's worth noting that the haptic bass can be quite intense at times, and some may find it overwhelming. But for those who enjoy a strong bass, this is a feature that sets the Skullcandy Crusher Evo apart from other headphones on the market.Overall, the Skullcandy Crusher Evo with Haptic Bass is a fantastic pair of headphones that delivers on its promise of an immersive audio experience with powerful bass and haptic feedback.

RJPJSZ6ZTCSOI,B08FCGH2RL,5.0 out of 5 stars haptic dingdongs work surprisingly well with some types of music,WF,5,"Straight to business, let's address the cons (kind of) or misconceptions about these headphones. Yes, there is real bass but if you're expecting the headphones to shake out of how much bass there actually is, don't. As you've probably noticed already the bass slider isn't really for the adjusting how much bass there is inside of the headphones, but basically adjusting the haptic motors (the stuff in controllers and whatnot that makes them vibrate) . Also, these headphones are actually on the quieter side of headphones so if you were looking for loud headphones, look elsewhere. The sensory bass doesn't always work with a lot of songs and actually murders some of them, acting as a very annoying vibrator when you have it turned on. Alright, now that all of the cons I could think of are out of the way, let's go on to the pros.The build quality is good, doesn't feel like I could break them unless I actually wanted to. They fit very nicely on my head ( what with the rotating earcups and flexibility and all ) I still have to adjust them sometimes but I think that goes for all headphones.The fact that these aren't that loud are actually fine, I wear these for long periods of time ( don't want that tinnitus ).Even my gripe with the fact that these murder some songs when you have the bass slider turned up, is kind of canceled out with the fact that you can just adjust it or just straight up turn it off for songs it just doesn't work with.I really like putting these on with lo-fi music, the haptic motors really give extra oomph to the kicks and since these aren't that (hot?) in terms of tuning, I feel like it's a fun and pleasant experience with this genre and has mainly been what I've been using it for.5/5 not what I bought it for but all things considered I'll take it.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2022",AGSOVEFN42OJIKC7PLGP4GAYPBUQ,True,4,Color: True Black

No shot, especially in FPS games and I don't gotta say why that's really bad for online ones.That defeated my main reason for buying them. HOWEVER, to my surprise and what made my decide to keep them is the electronics in these aren't just for the bass boost, these actually have an amplifier in them so you're getting better and louder audio when they're on, even if plugged in via aux. I will however say...the price is still pretty steep and it's debatable if they're worth it and I got em discounted at 165 USD. If these were more like idk 100$, that's still at a premium, but much more of a realistic price in my opinion. Otherwise though, they're great, audio sounds really good over all, but the clear focus of these is if you're really into bass heavy music or playing online FPS games, crushers are amazing for FPS games because the bass boost makes footsteps much louder and anything bass in general even in movies just sounds much cooler.","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2023",AHVRXTP4FTHESMVKLMMBWQPI5QWA,True,1,Color: Grey

Skullcandy was a brand back in highschool where you would never want to be seen wearing them (2000's). It was what distinguished brand names from the 'poor man's music'. Crusher Evo makes me now dial up the bass and screw the haters if they still believe that nonsense. Yes these headphones don't have any noise cancellation but I have never used noise cancellation even if the headphones had them. Noise cancellation is not reliable and is prone to give off hissing sounds. Also, these headphones remind me of the times I would turn up my subwoofers loud while driving. These headphones I would say are an essential piece for bass lovers. If you want clear sounds while sacrificing bass, i would recommend consumers to research other brand of headphones to suit their audio style. The bass control knob on these headphones is helpful for regulating certain song's bass, especially if you use a 3rd-party epicenter audio function for songs.For phone and video conversations, my voice projects well. The microphone picks up my voice and doesn't distort it. It isn't the best microphone in the market but it suffices for my daily commute to workIn regards to quality, these headphones are well-made. They aren't flimsy. You notice well how they feel. It comes with a usb-c cable, audio aux cable, and a headphone bag with the manuals.I would have enjoyed if the headphone bag was more rigid but because the price is already low compared to others on the market, I feel it was worth the sacrifice I made.I also have a fairly large head. Headphones fit nicely at max extension. I feel these headphones would benefit if they could extend a few inches.I would recommend this to bass lovers.

Now it only takes about half an hour until it hurts my head. My father and brother can't wear them either because of how tight they squeeze. My ears fit perfectly inside the cushioning, which helps, but they just squeeze super tight. I occasionally switch to my wireless earbuds to get relief while still listening. I can't live without music, so I just deal with the headache. I don't want to return them because they work well and they look amazing.

You can't alternate between devices with this headphone's Bluetooth.

R2RUMUO1GMQ7JX,B08MVGF24M,3.0 out of 5 stars Not everything I ever dreamed of...,Andrew Cousineau,3,"I spent more on these headphones than I ever have on a pair of headphones before, so I was hoping that on top of the normal duties of a pair of headphones, that they would also wash my dishes and walk my dog for me ect. To be fair, they are probably the best headphones I've ever owned (which they should be as they're like double the price of the last 'expensive' pair I bought), but they didn't really wow me either.The noise cancelling and sound quality is generally fine. I'm a bassist, so if the bass is emphasized, I'm happy. I don't really notice the bass to be particularly heavy. I can usually distinctly hear bass lines if I make a conscious effot, but they don't tend to overpower (which I prefer, but I know a lot of people don't). I haven't messed around with the equalizer much so I can't speak to that. My issue with the sound quality is in the ambient sound mode. The ambient sound mode makes the ambient sounds sound horrible. This is largely my first experience with noise cancelling, so I don't have anything to compare it to, maybe we just don't have the tech yet to amplify sounds and not make them sound tinney and horrible. But yeah, it legit sounds like I'm listening to the world through a tin can. As a result I rarely use the ambient sound mode (this mode has noise cancelling but allows for some noises to come through) and rather just use the noise cancelling mode when I want to be aware of my surroundings.These headphones have several annoying features that if I knew I'd dislike so much I would've gone for another pair of headphones. First, the touch controls. Apparently there are some people out there who like the touch controls, but are they really necessary when buttons exist? Touch controls only make sense when there is a screen you can look at or at least some sort of tactile cue that reassures you that you're doing the thing you want to be doing. The two most important functions (on/off, and sound cancelling level) are controlled by real buttons, but pause, skip, and volume are all controlled by touch controls on the outside surface of the right headphone. Unless you are sitting perfectly still these are pretty much impossible to use and can result in unwanted pauses and skips. The #1 time I wear these is when I walk/run my dog. I cannot use the touch controls when I'm running and can occasionally use them while I'm walking, but they tend to be very imprecise. So to turn up the volume I have to do the motion like 3 times until I accidentally skip the song instead. This isn't a rare problem where most of the time I can use them fine. This happens the vast majority of times I try to use the touch controls when I'm moving - I'm actually pleasantly surprised if I can do the correct gesture while walking. Some people may argue that I have failed to learn how to use the touch controls (I've had these headphones for 6+ months), but there really shouldn't be a learning curve for being able to pause music - this is a design failure.I also wear these to the gym quite often. The other problem that I have with the touch controls is that I cannot do any sort of exercise with my arms overhead (pull ups, overhead press, ect.) with these on because my shoulder will touch the outside surface and pause or skip. I usually end up taking them off for my set.So, if you're the least bit hesitant about the touch controls, I'd say check out your other options because if I knew they'd be this frustrating I would've bought different headphones.The second overall problem I have with these headphones is how much talking they do. So you'd think, turn them on and play music, right? No, its turn them on, it says ""Power on"". Then it tells you ""Bluetooth connected"" - cool, good to know I can now turn on my music and listen... Unless I have a second device nearby and it says ""Bluetooth second device connected"". Then (because I'm walking my dog away from my second device) it plays a sound to tell me that device has been disconnected. Then I change the noise cancelling level... ""Ambient sound"" which sounds bad so I press the button again... ""Ambient Sound control off"". The robot talks so damn slow, it's literally like a minute of messing around before I can just listen to my music. Y'all really couldn't abbreviate any of this or make it talk faster? And if I want to change the noise cancelling level while listening to music or a podcast I best pause the song otherwise I'll miss half of it listening to the robot tell me what I know I'm doing and can hear the difference between. This is all a bit of an exaggeration, but it's enough to frustrate me. For a $300 pair of headphones I think I have the right to be impatient.Another minor thing that might not actually be the fault of the headphones is they have trouble with certain apps. Sometimes I'll press play on my phone but it won't play through the headphones for like 10 seconds or sometimes more (which is enough time to make me think something is wrong). Again, the headphones could be innocent here - they tend to work fine with the Apple Music app, but not the Apple Podcast app. I'm leaning towards blaming the app.Also the headphones generally comfy to wear. I have a small head, and they can fall off if I'm laying down but its not a huge issue.Overall, these are good headphones, but they have some design choices that make the headphones annoying to use which is frustrating for the price. If these break I won't buy another pair and would likely look for ones that don't have touch control, but I didn't think these issues were enough of a problem to get a refund or anything.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AHVIBRANSX6ITQCAF6SA5XNMQNAA,True,2,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
RJE80FBWZNCH6,B08MVGF24M,5.0 out of 5 stars Mind blowing noise cancellation,Hugo Stiglitz,5,"The noise cancellation is insane. The first time i turned them on i couldnt believe it. I was used to pretty weak NC, and these are supposed to be the best. What a differenceOne thing i hadnt thought of is that noise cancellation actually does make a big difference to sound quality while previously i didnt think it was that important. But because it gives you an almost silent environment, everything sounds better.I also love that it has LDAC support. The transmission rate is automatic and unfortunately rarely uses the highest quality, but you can force it with developer options on any android phone (look up a guide to do that). The connection is perfect on the lower settings and you can go 100ft away from your phone and itll still work fine. Its only at the highest setting that theres any issues, but IMO its still worth using if you have high res audio files. Its near indistinguishable from the sound quality of a wired connection at the point (and assuming youre not in a totally silent envionment with NC off.TThe only weak point is the frequency response, but its also personal preference. Its balanced but bass heavy which a lot of people like. I don't. In my opinion it should be more neutral.When audio professionals mix and master music, they already put in as much bass as they can (in modern music) so there's no need for headphones to add even more. They know what theyre doing so it makes no sense to me to try and ""enhance"" what doesnt need to be ""enhanced""Unfortunately most consumers think more bass = better so headphone makers aren't afraid to add more than is necessary especially when other manufacturers add a ton, meaning if you don't as well people might say your product has weak bass, which isn't the case at all","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AF2WNSSZUVLPCMWGE7LNOXZTLGPQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R1KYYRPR3VE2DG,B08MVGF24M,4.0 out of 5 stars Get these...at the right price,H. Ricks,4,"I got these as a 2023 Christmas upgrade from the XB-900. I loved their sound quality (especially the bass of the XB-900), but it lacked conveniences that made it difficult to use those on a regular basis (being that I'm in the Apple ecosystem (iPhone/iPad/Mac and Apple TV). When they were around 30% off, it was a no-brainer.The ANC is still great. They may not be on the level of AirPods Max, but they're just as good as the XM-500's. The sound quality is more 'balanced,' so while you don't get massive bass (like the XB series, Skullcrusher or Sony Ult), they can keep up.But my favorite aspects, coming from the XB900's, are its ability to multi-pair between 2 devices. It was frustrating to have to go through a process just to switch devices. Granted, you have to use the app to enable them between devices, but that's still better than having to go into bluetooth settings and unpair, then re-pair.Also, I like the play/pause gesture feature that weren't on the XB900. While it wasn't that much of a biggie (be it tap the cup to pause or pause on the app or device), it felt more natural to just take them off for it to pause your media. And, unlike some of Apple's offerings, I like that you can create your own EQ settings than their stock settings.While it took some time to modify the settings for ANC/pass-through (based on work/home/travel environments), the experience when using is great.Overall...the XM-400's are as good as the newer 'flagship' XM500 (almost forgot: they fold better...be around your neck or case). You're getting great sound, great ANC, great battery life, decent build (albeit plastic) and great customization. But if you get these when on sale (especially around or under $230), you're getting a premium device at a 'Goldilocks' price!My 3 cents...","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AH34Y7RKTMJ47UGXWZPX25J3JMZQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

Overall I'm very happy with them and I will be bringing them with me every time I travel on a plane.Pros:-Excellent noise canceling-Very good battery life. They last much longer than an ipad or phone when watching movies.-Can still be used as regular wired headphones if the battery dies, or if bluetooth isn't an option, like with an airplane screen. I should note that the noise canceling will still work when wired if the battery is good.-Nice small case for travelingCons:-They are kind of small for over the ear style headphones, so you probably won't like them if you have large ears.-Most of the controls aren't actual buttons, so it's hard to figure them out.

R32NKDVGVF2QPR,B08MVGF24M,5.0 out of 5 stars Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works great!,JWH,5,"The Sony WH-1000XM4 Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works great! Put on the headphones, turn on the power and it's like the aircraft engines have turned off - the low rumble is just gone. Entertainment doesn't have to be turned as loud in order to hear it clearly.The best thing about the Sony is that it can be used ""wired"" into airline entertainment, rather than having always to rely on finicky BlueTooth. The Sony comes with a two-prong adapter to fit the airlines two-prong plug holes, but the adapter isn't necessary (at least on United Airliness 787 aircraft). It appeared to me the two-prong aircraft sockets were made up of 3.5mm and a 2.5mm holes. (I didn't have a 2.5mm plug, so I can't swear to that.) The Sony jack was 3.5mm and it worked well plugging it into the other, 3.5mm, socket - complete stereo worked. From testing at home I'd say the wired configuration provides slightly better sound than through BlueTooth, also. Wired appears to provide better power usage, too; I used it on a 17-hour flight for three movies, I think, and arrived with the power level at 80% from starting at 90%.It does require a bit of a learning curve, so I wouldn't expect a newbie like me to pull it out of the box for the first time while on the aircraft and expect it to be satisfying. This is my first ANC device in maybe 10 years and that first experience wasn't successful, so it took me awhile to try again. Basically, hold the power button for two seconds to turn it on, hold it for seven seconds to pair with BlueTooth. You can get by without the Sony headphones app, but without it you won't know the battery charge level or be able to change sound profiles; I want to hear dialog better, so I have bass present, but not overwhelmingly so. Interestingly, you can pair the headphones with two devices at the same time, while other ANC earbuds just switch fast between two different connections. Both appear to work okay and allow you to listen to your cellphone music or the aircraft entertainment. Sony has short little movies that walked me through headphone settings.That's a lot of ""pro,"" but there are a few ""cons."" Over-ear headsets are bulky and have to be carried in already stuffed carry-on luggage. Some people don't like the pressure of over-ear headsets on their ears. That's about it, though, and if you've bought them at all then these issues don't sneak up on you. I've had them for a month or so now so I can't speak to their sturdiness or long-term reliability, but they do appear to be sturdy and the case protects them.What would I like to see improved? Not much, for over-ear ANC headsets. If I could find a set of wired ANC earbuds I'd surely try them to cut down on the bulk, but they'd have to work very well to provide the same sense of isolation I get from over-ear headsets. As things are, this Sony is definitely a ""buy.""","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023",AEGS73DFBTN563YPSMA2EM2EEEAA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

R3LOW0OAVZVPNN,B08MVGF24M,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise canceling, everything else is ok",MyHonest2Cents,4,"In passive mode, the sound quality is all over the place, resulting in some of the worst headphones I've ever used in this price bracket. In active mode, it's... decent, with boomy, mildly unclean bass; acceptable mids; and messy but listenable highs. It is very responsive to EQ past sub-bass range, though you can crank up the already boomy mid-bass if that's your thing and it can get pretty loud. At about 70–80% volume, the amp begins to distort, and at 100% volume the distortion is highly audible and really crunches the highs and muddies the bass. There is also a noticeable frequency response and volume difference between the cups, likely due to the indentation for the sensor array inside the left cup; if you aren't listening for it, it is still noticeable sometimes, but it fades to the background if you are using the noise canceling or are otherwise occupied.The ambient sound feature does not pick up outside sounds very clearly. If you're using the Sony | Headphones Connect app, you can enable a ""voice mode"" for ambient sound that cuts out the bass and boosts vocal range with EQ, but it cannot be turned on with the toggle buttons on the headphones themselves or when connected to PC, making it tedious to enable without the automatic switching feature that tracks your location and habits to enable it when it thinks you need it. The noise canceling however is truly top of its class and easily removes 80–90% of outside noise, and you can't hear anything else if you're playing something. I have noticed that the DSP appears to crank up the bass, either to compensate for the harder-to-remove low-end frequencies or to trick you into thinking the noise canceling is better than it really is in that range.The ear cup touch controls work fine and I have not had any mis-inputs, though volume up/down steps are too small. You can hold down the up/down slider instead of repeatedly sliding your finger, but the repeat delay is very long and it takes forever to adjust to what you want.The headphones are fairly adjustable to different head shapes, but if you have a reeeally big head/ears or lots of hair it may be difficult. The headband padding is a bit hard but the headphones are so light you can't feel it. The closed cups have no ventilation so your ears stay warm, and I imagine it would get sweaty in warmer weather.The headphones can fold flat and can sit around your neck comfortably. The auto-pause when it detects you remove them, and the 15 minute auto-off means you don't ever need to bother turning them off explicitly, just take them off your head and put them down. Their ability to fold also works great for stowing them, and you can fit them into any bag. The included carry case is a bit bulkier than it probably needs to be, but it's still small enough to fit in even a medium sized purse, and it does have room for cables and small accessories.The mic quality is pretty bad and doesn't pick up your voice well. What it does pick up well is everything around you. You'd think Sony's engineers could have used the ambient sound mics to dampen outside noise while focusing on your voice, but it unfortunately doesn't do that. Call sound quality in general takes a major dive due to the protocol it uses under the hood; it halves the sample rate and sounds like a cheap dollar store headset.The battery is massive; I charged it to 90% once I received it a few days ago and have not had to charge it since with daily listening. Rtings.com got 37 hours out of one charge, far past the advertised duration.Overall all of the features work to an acceptable level, except passive mode sound quality. If you are buying these for the battery longevity, small stowable size, ease of use, and noise isolation and canceling, they're a great package. Great for traveling. Would not recommend for even casual listening, get a good closed back pair like the Hifiman HE-R9 + Bluemini R2R wireless dongle. If you need to make important calls or want headphones for conference calls or online meetings, these will work, but it won't be pleasant—get a dedicated conference headset.If you really insist on these for more active listening situations, do yourself a favor and get the AutoEQ preset for them as a baseline, and tweak to your ears. I also recommend a -1dB loss on the left earcup to help offset the response difference, though it's an approximation and not perfect and differences in track volume will make this obvious. With these changes, passive mode is at least bearable.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2022",AGXVB4UEYOJCFXO6XR45I52IWWWQ,True,7,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

R1JKUN1J8FVF5H,B08MVGF24M,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beast Headphones, solid Noise-cancelling/ beautiful sound/ Comfort.. But don't pay full price.",xnpate,4,"Last several months I've spent studying for MCAT, and as it neared the exam I needed more time away from distractions and due to the pandemic sneaking away to my local libraries wasn't an option as I could only be there for an hour or two tops, I needed NC headphones being at home. Typically anytime I saw anything NC the WH1000 series was the way to go, as advised by the tech world and audiophiles. I had found a good deal on Airpods Pro and during Prime Day Deals found these. I was shocked to find the latest Sony headphones discounted $50 and bundled with $25 Amazon GC as well. The reason I mention Airpods is because I personally have seen many comparisons. I'll break down as much as I can below, I don't consider myself an audiophile.Pros:When it comes to sound and listening to music with the Sonys hands-down best thing I've listened to and gives like new life to music. These are built really nicely and cushioned really well up top and around the ears. Oh man boy are they lightweight!. Some heat around my ears after using them for a bit, and they press on my glasses (but they're crappy glasses that I have problems with beforehand anyway) so they press in my ears/head.Battery: Lasts me several uses on one charge, meaning I can use them a good 4-5 days before wanting to charge them. Sometimes I can get a couple hours in and still not even lose 10% of battery life. (when compared to Airpods, no question Sonys better). When not used for a period of time they will automatically shut off so even better.Case: Nice holds your cords and headphones nicely. It's not a hard case though so I'd be careful shoving them into tight spaces against things.While i mentioned the cables... Sony needs to make the charging cable longer it's INCREDIBLY short.Cons:Touch controls: The lack of buttons to control Play/Pause, Volume, kind of sucks for me. At first it seems fun and intriguing. But over the course of using them, I find myself swiping and hearing the feedback that something is being activated but actually wont happen. There are moments when I'm stretching or resting my behind my head and arm knicks the touch control and pauses the music. And this is weird because the touchpad can be really sensitive like in that example, but other times wont register I'm trying to activate the controls. Volume should absolutely just be a wheel, pause/play skip features as touch I'd be okay with.Dual connection: I haven't had much use of this, at first I had my laptop and iPhone connected. Now Idk if my problem is due to my older computer with older Bluetooth, but my sound went silent on my headphones. I haven't connected them back to my laptop since. But I think ideally this would be great to be connected to your phone/computer and get notifications. There is a delay between activating playback from one device to the next.Mic: Friends have told me my voice sounds artificial with Sonys and prefer if I wear my Airpods to communicate if I want to use headphones.Noise-CancellingTo anyone who wants a comparison between Airpods Pro and these. If I hadn't had Airpods Pro right before purchasing these I'd have nothing poor to say about the Sony's NC. Airpods as they go in the ear already help with dulling sound before activating NC. The biggest issue I have in my house is the droning of my AC and Fans. Airpods make them disappear and sound like a light breeze or wind without all the mechanical droning from noise machinery. Sonys do a good job for those sounds for me, but not as well as the Airpods. HOWEVER, this is before any music or sound playing. Once you have something playing with the Sonys the world is gone and that's about half-ish volume. I find myself speaking louder at times not even being able to realize my brother is talking right next to me. I don't necessarily have the same effect with Airpods. And you don't have to worry about fit.ConnectivityI've heard that with Android getting the XM4 connected is quick, but even with iPhone it's simply connecting another Bluetooth device. (compared to airpods obviously the apple interface is as simple as opening your headphone case)AppPretty easy to follow interface, readily updates. If you like experimenting with equalizer settings then you'll have fun. I've heard people complain it being complicated, but without messing with anything except turning off a setting that pauses audio when talking. You can leave everything as is and really not need it after the initial setup and for updates.Final thoughts if you have the money I'd go for these they're wonderful, but I don't think these warrant the full price TBH. The touch controls can be finicky, but if you want quality sound/NC/Comfort/Fit this is it. Anyone seeing this right during the holidays with BlackFriday/Christmas/Cyberdeals whatever; I was shocked seeing these brand new Sonys discounted to the same price as the XM3 on Amazon, I'd look for these and nab them when discounted.","Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2020",AFY3JHUWWTAHBJZNBVXSOOORVGMQ,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

The noise cancellation is amazing and the adaptive sound is cool and all but wearing them for a prolonged period does take a toll. Due to them not having holes in the ears very little air flow is noticed making your ears like a sauna. I've worn these to workout countless times and I can say that they don't feel comfortable at all when in high-intensity situations solely due to the zero air flow.

R11GP1556DW75I,B08MVGF24M,"5.0 out of 5 stars Beyond anything I could have imagined...if noise distracts, buy back your productivity!",Mike,5,"I have used active noise canceling technology in protective ear muffs, and I have had some ear buds that were passive noise canceling, so I kind of thought I had an idea what these where going to be like. Nothing could prepare me for my first impression, and we’ll every subsequent impression.My wife does telemedicine from home, and soon we plan to add another dedicated office, but for right now we share a room. The distraction of having a constant conversation in the background has driven me to feel like a nomad - wandering from flat spot to flat spot. The laptop isn’t an issue, but the scanner, 32” monitor, keyboard, keypad, paperwork,etc...well you get the point. So I found a 17” led up in the attic...no go, for the record don’t ever get used to one size monitor than essentially try to get use to one 1/4th that size. I tried listening to music with my passive ear buds, finally I used my protective muffs that I have for mowing, shooting, anything loud and it sort of worked but those try to defeat harmful noise levels. I tried wearing earbuds playing music underneath the muffs and while that worked, my ears however felt like they had been in a vice.Well that leads me to these, while these are more costly than anything I ever have purchased for audio - other than my home theater equipment. Let me say now I’m case I am being wordy, these are worth every penny.I can be attached to both my iPhone and laptop, so I can get feedback from my computer or listen to audio and still here when I get an alert on my phone. When I wish, the head phones do not require any actual music or anything. I literally feel like I am alone in a “cone of silence” for those familiar with the old Get Smart episodes. If my wife or any other family member needs me it is easier to text me than to call out to me. While that is a little inconvenient, my ability to concentrate has increased multi-fold which has also allowed my productivity to feeling a pure joy rather than the stress of always feeling like you need to do more.These are also light, and have no issue navigating by size 8 head. The app setup for these is wild. I have done moldable ear plugs, but I never dreamed I would take a selfie and then snap shots of each ear to customize the sound. The other fascinating thing happened completely by accident, I was listening to a presentation online but needed to work on dinner. I thought I paused the pc and joined on the phone. But evidently I never stopped the pc and hearing audio I didn’t worry about anything. Well I realized that my pc was communicating with the Sony app and the app was evidently acting like a radio repeater...I was out of range of my office but set my phone out of the way where it won’t get wet, dropped or anything else. It was only when I tried to stop the presentation did I realize what had occurred. I now use this all the time and have subsequently learned to pause/play with the controls. Lastly, and this will completely give away the secret that I never read instructions...I could not figure out how to connect a phone call. I used the buttons like I do on my other Bluetooth earbuds, but that didn’t work. I felt stupid when I learned all that I had to do was tap the center of the right muff.I know this is a lot of money, and While it is rare for productivity be literally monetized unless you are on commission, I can tell you that these allow for peace in total chaos...oh, if I had these 20 years ago when our second child was colicky🙂.I normally buy black by default, grey if black isn’t available, but my wife encouraged me to try the blue. While I am color blind, I still see color, amd like the blue...my wife also likes the color which is way more important. I am starting to sense that I will be buying another pair of these for my wife because when she is charting on her EMR distractions are awful.","Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2021",AGR7CTQV4ETCIWAPZDP42W5V6EQA,True,3,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only

R3V25GSVN3M9AR,B08MVGF24M,"4.0 out of 5 stars UPDATED: Excellent sound & Comfort, Subpar Ergonomics, Auto-Shut Off Does Not Work as Expected",Richard N. Barg,4,"Note: this review is substantially changed. I forgot to proofed the initial review.I also own a pair of Bose QC 35s. The XM4s are definitely more comfortable and easier to wear for a longer period of time. They have less clamping and carbon pressure than the QC 35s, which really surprised me. I owned the XM-3s briefly before returning them. The XM4s, in my view, are considerably more comfortable, especially the headband which no longer exerts a downward force. The QC-35s, still being sold, seem ancient. I have also tried the somewhat polarizing Bose 700s. I’m not a fan, but concede, for phone calls, they are revolutionary in the way they use microphones to produce a clear sound even in noisy environments.The DSEE Extreme audio enhancement option does wonders for the sound, especially on audiobooks and podcasts. The rest of the app is spartan and lackluster.The XM4s device pairs very well with Bluetooth (BT) devices such as my iPhone and iPad, now simultaneously although you do lose the ability to use certain Codecs. BT on the XMS blow away the QC 35s in terms of initially connectivity, notably speed, have superior distance/range and duration of Bluetooth signal. Dropouts even next to the microwave oven, are minimal. The ability to connect two devices simultaneously to BT is a game-changer and a massive upgrade from the XM3s.The chat to talk function is useless and annoying and easy to accidentally turn on.The XM4 ssuffer from a lack of dedicated volume control dials. Car manufacturers removed this feature on their Infotainment system, notably Honda, and customers rightly pushed back. And now the volume controls dials are back. The Bose QC-35s, whatever it other shortcomings and dated design, have dedicated rocker switches that are far superior to the touchpad on the XM4s. Among other things they don’t beep when you raise or lower the volume. That beep is annoying and interferes with what you were listening to.In windy or rainy condition, the touchpad is unreliable, often activated by gusts and raindrops with unexpected results. With inclement weather and outdoors, I fall back to my trusty QC-35s.The touchpad suffers from another vice. You can easily invoke fast forward or rewind instead of the touchpad volume controls if your finger lands in the wrong place, which happens periodically by the law of averages. If you are an older adult whose hand motor skills have declined, have tremor, or Parkinson’s, by all means disable the touchpad. I find it somewhat difficult to easily orient the headphones, that is to quickly glean which is the left for the right ear cup when putting them on. Sony could have done a better job with a more conspicuous visual indicator.The phone call experience on the XM4s is superior to the Bose Q3-35s, but substantially inferior to the Bose 700s which blow away all the competition (Full disclosure - have not tested Apple’s new headphones). The active noise canceling on the XM4s seem superior to the Bose QC35s. The use of USB-C to charge the headphones is a vast improvement on Micro-USB.Sony has been, at a minimum, disingenuous, and arguably actively misleading the consumer in representing that the XM4s have auto-shut-off when that feature is enabled. In fact, auto-shut-off ONLY disables the noise canceling feature, which saves battery life, but does NOT turn off but the headphones. If you don’t remember to manually turn them off, you will invariably be greeted at some point with an inopportune “low battery” warning. Sony can and should do better. There is no reason the feature cannot work as represented.The Bose QC 35s, by contrast have a well-implemented auto-shut-off. And its very quick to manually turn them off with a rocker switch. With the XM4s, you have to hold down a button for an interminable 2-3 seconds. I simply plug in my XM4s to USB-C every night to ensure I have a charged set of headphones, How this will affect the battery life long-term is unknown.The XM4 case works, but is a bit weird. You have to do through numerous contortions to fold the headphones in such a way that they fit in the case. The cutout guides are so some helps, but overall the case on the QC-35s is simpler and allows for quickly storing them. The zipper on the Sony XM4s is of an inferior quality and often hangs, requiring you back up the zipper forward progress and start again.Thus I heartily recommend the XM4s, but with some reservations.","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2021",AHCZHHNMP4MTYNJLGUE4UHGPLLBA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

They arrived in nice packaging, and the carrying case they come with is decently compact and also good quality. I've had them for 1.5 years now, and after daily, extensive use, they are still doing fine. I may have to replace the ear pads in the next year, but that's an easy process and only around $20 for replacement parts. I got these on sale, and I recommend anyone interested wait for a prime or sale day for them to go on sale for like $200. They charge very quickly and last me a good couple days of all-day use on a full charge, even after 1.5 years. I'm not one to go into the equalizer and change stuff, so the basic sound settings sound great to me. The noise cancelling is good on transit and in the office. On transit or airplanes, it's also nice that you can hold your hand to the right ear, and it will enhance any announcements while quieting the music, so you don't have to actually remove the headphones. Noise cancelling in general doesn't do much for talking sounds, but the ear pads cup the ear and head nicely so you can't hear talking much either.One thing I wish they could change is the feedback beep the headphones make whenever you interact with the touch pad on the right ear. I get some people might appreciate it, but I spent a while when I first got the headphones trying to figure out how to turn it off. I got used to it after a month or so, but I had hoped for a bit more customizability. Tap to pause, a quiet beep, tap to play, another beep.

R2NRCSDUHP4IOM,B08MVGF24M,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound and Comfort, But Some Reliability Issues",Christopher J. Giannelli,4,"I recently purchased my second pair of these noise-canceling headphones, and I've had enough time to thoroughly evaluate their performance. Here's my take on them:Pros:Comfort: They're incredibly comfortable, even during long listening sessions.Appearance: The black design is sleek and aesthetically pleasing.Build Quality: These headphones feel high quality and durable, built to last.Noise Cancellation: The noise cancellation is nothing short of spectacular. It effectively blocks out background noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience.Multi-Device Connectivity: Being able to connect to two devices simultaneously is a game-changer. It's a convenience that sets these headphones apart from others I've owned.Sound Quality: The audio and music sound quality is exceptional, with rich bass and clear treble that make for an awesome listening experience.Cons:High-Pitched Squealing: My first pair occasionally emitted a high-pitched squealing noise. It was so severe that I had to power them off. Unfortunately, the issue sometimes persisted even after turning them back on, leading me to purchase a second pair.Connectivity Issues: After about a year, my new pair began to experience connectivity problems, suddenly stopping audio playback. The only workaround is to power them off and back on, which is quite frustrating and happens all too often.Not ideal for working out: When doing horizontal exercises, like push ups, bench press, rows, etc. these tend to fall off because of the weight. If you're upright however, these are great. Although I'm not sure how the sweat effects them over time, hopefully that won't damage them?Overall:Despite the drawbacks, I genuinely love these headphones. They offer superior comfort, sound quality, and the unique ability to connect to two devices at once. However, I've encountered reliability issues with both pairs I've owned, from the distressing squealing noise in the first pair to connectivity problems in the second. While I would still recommend them for their outstanding features and performance, I do hope the manufacturer addresses these reliability issues in future models.","Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2024",AFFMUCTTNHASAJ3W3YURACQ4ALUA,True,7,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

Before buying the Sony WH1000XM4, I had never ventured over the $200.00 mark. As far as wireless goes, I was fairly happy with the two IEMs and one headphone set from Soundcore.

R2SUXCOAV9YSTQ,B08MVGF24M,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent headphones with minor complaints,Joe k,4,"So I am coming from the Bose QC II, which I thoroughly enjoyed. So that will be the headphones ill compare these to. In terms of sound quality they are pretty neck and neck in this category, but I will give the slight advantage to the Sony headphones because they have an EQ on the app. The Bose headphones I felt had better highs, whereas the Sony headphones have much better lows. the mids really are not that much different in my opinion, although I'm not the best judge because I've only ever really used Beyerdynamics dt770s, so I'm not an audiophile by any means.If you listen to hiphop most of the time like I do, these headphones are great and much preferred over the Bose because of a significantly more punchy bass, like seriously, the Bose hardly have bass. However it isn't just hiphop, I also listen to electronic and a lot of fantasy music, like movie and game soundtracks. And these are fantastic for both.Next I will talk about comfort, this is one of the things I dislike about the Sony headphones, but also, this is entirely preference and head shape dependent. I noticed with the Sony headphones the top part of the headphone will hurt the top of my head in a much shorter time than the Bose headphones. Also the ear cups aren't the most comfortable, as I can feel my ears pressed up against the inside of the cups. In my opinion the Bose headphones are more comfortable here, especially over longer periods of time(I wear these headphones at least 6 hours everyday) But that's not to say the Sony headphones are not comfortable, they are very comfortable, more comfortable than my Beyerdynamic dt770 to be honest. They are just not as good as the Bose QC II's, but both are fantastic in this department. I'm not saying the Sony headphones are uncomfortable, I'm just saying they are more uncomfortable than the Bose headphones in my opinion.Next is design and color. So I really really like the color on the Sony headphones, the greyish looks so clean, and id be lying if I said that was not part of the reason why I switched. In terms of looks I love the Sony headphones way more. They just appeal to me more than the more egg shape Bose QC II's. Also the weight of the headphones is about the same, I think maybe the QC II's were slightly lighter, but its not an issue by any means, they are both really light.One of the things I hate most about the Sony headphones is the touch functionality, its a nuisance, to say the least. To the point where I actively try to avoid using the touch functions, like volume up, down, next song, previous, pause, etc. This is a prime example of putting unnecessary tech functions on a product, sort of like how they put tablets on a fridge now--like why? I way prefer the physical buttons on the QC II's. But I always wear an apple watch, and always have my phone on me so its pretty easy for me to change volume and songs on my watch/phone. But still, on the Bose headphones, I used the physical buttons all the time.A lot of times I will accidently pause the song by readjusting the headphones(readjusting needs to happen semi-frequently when wearing them at the gym), also if I try to use the touch controls --because for some reason I always think maybe this time it will be different. It usually ends up with me accidently swiping forward instead of up which will change the song. It is incredibly frustrating.Battery life is next, and Sony wins by 10 hours here, these are insane. 30 hours is great battery life, and it charges with USB-C rather than the older usb ports on the bose. No complaints here.Honestly, Its sort of hard to give these 4 stars, because they really are incredible, but I think because of the incredibly frustrating touch functionality, and the slightly uncomfortable ear cups I have to dock a star, if I could dock half I probably would, 4.5 is a pretty accurate rating, I would give these a 5 stars if they just removed the touch controls, and fixed the earcups somehow.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2021",AFVRXTQ5UZV3R4X6CIHDRIC676HQ,True,2,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only

They fit snug and comfortable on my head, while wearing my glasses or even a baseball cap.The audio quality for something wireless was surprising, and when paired with LDAC codec on an Android device (I've got a Samsung ZFold 5) you can expect a fulfilling wireless headphone experience. Needless to say, they are still non-comparable with a wired, audiophile grade headphone. I use DT-990s paired to a Soundblaster X G6 at my PC for context. Definitely do not expect that kind of performance.The Sony Headphones app is great and allows for a customized EQ and presets, atmospheric pressure for ANC, speak features, etc. App is easy to use and offers some greatly appreciated features for most if not all users.In conclusion, I feel like they're a great purchase - especially if you can catch them on a sale. I've got no complaints and feel like the value for product is more than worth it for these headphones even at MSRP.Lastly, I do not recommend these for an Apple product user, as you will not be able to take advantage of the LDAC audio codec, which increases audio quality with these headphones significantly! Unfortunately, Apple has not made an effort to include this codec in their audio compatibility.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2024",AFPPLK7P4OSS3OG2PWMMB25VB6YA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

Also, I would use then on the airplane as full headsets are more comfortable than earbuds for me. I was moving into a new career and decided I deserved a treat.Features I love...1) Hold one hand over the right ear when noise cancellation is on, and it will deactivate for when you have to talk to someone in the room briefly. Take your hand away, and noise cancelling resumes.2) Music stops playing / pauses when you remove them and resumes when you put them back on (as long as it isn't too long. They do shut off automatically after a certain amount of time)3) I can be hooked up to my phone and computer at the same time4) Ambient sound mode really magnifies the sound around you, which is sometimes very beneficial5) Very comfortable on the head6) Swiveling ear pieces that fold in. This is why I went with the 4 and not the 57) Noise cancellation. I've tried other high end headphones, and these are just as good if not better.8) Control different options by making different types of swipes or taps on the ear pieces.For my first pair of high tech headphones, I am extremely pleased.

R3SXVEP7ZDKCSF,B08MVGF24M,4.0 out of 5 stars My Take,Amazon Customer,4,"The Sony WH-1000XM4’s is a comfortable pair of headphones, designed for comfort, convenience, and to provide a whole new hearing experience with music and audio. Its base focus is ergonomic meaning it has adjustable bands, a comfortable padding, and smart controls that you can customize to suit your preferences. In March 2021, I was searching for a new pair of headphones for my birthday and this happened to come up. At that time it was priced around $300 but I did some further research and thought that these headphones would be a good investment because for one; I like to listen to music and two; I loved the features.Some of the strong aspects of the Sony WH-1000XM4 include the smart features, the app, customizable controls, battery life, and an ergonomic design for comfort. The smart controls can also be connected with the Sony Headphones App and it can also connect up to two devices at once. There is also a speak-to-chat function meaning that if you are wearing the headphones with music on and you start to talk to someone, it will automatically pause the music for you. Once you stop talking, it will resume the music. Besides this, it also has an ambience, normal, and noise-cancelling mode. It can be switched with the side button. Another one of its strengths is that these headphones have the ability to read the environment. When I used to ride my bike to the park while listening to music, they would switch to ambience mode for me to hear the cars and the music would be on low. As for the customizable controls, you can control the sound elements that you want either to be higher or lower within the app to maximize your listening experience. They also have some presets available but I usually stick with the ones I customize. I used them almost everyday and these are the most comfortable headphones so far. The hold is not too tight or loose. They also have Google Assistant and Alexa Built-In. But my most favorite part about these headphones is that I can change the track, change the volume, or make calls with just a tap or swipe on the right ear. The paddings are comfortable. The battery life on these are 30 hours and just charging for 10 minutes will give you 5 hours.Despite these strengths, there are also some flaws. Sometimes when I talk to someone, having the music stop can become annoying. But I changed the controls in the app so that it does not pause the music. Another flaw is that the microphone on these headphones are not good. I heard that from most of my friends, it sounds muffled and unclear. I have to carry the Apple Wired Earphones if I have a meeting to join because the microphone quality on those are better than the Sony WH-1000XM4 (though I heard that the newest one 1000XM5’s have a better microphone). However, I think it is partially my fault for not setting up the microphone. I also wished they came in more colors.Overall, these are one of the top industries’ best headphones. It is a great investment that will improve your audio/music experience. I recommend it to those who have to study a lot, travel a lot, or maybe those who like to up their music game. For the final grade, I give it an A. Depending on what you look for in headphones, the Sony WH-1000XM4’s are a good investment that will bring value to your lifestyle. Wear it with an outfit and it will also become part of the look.","Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2023",AE3XOTZX4POH3IUEKKHWWSFNO4GQ,True,4,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only

The overall experience is amazing and Ive been loving my music a lot more but the headphones leak noise once you exceed a certain volume so if you're putting them in blast everyone will hear what you're listening to. The only thing I can compare it to are my AirPods pros but between the two I would go with these headphones, you really get to feel the music and feel like you're really there.The headphones feel like you could easily break with a single wrong move or turn them the wrong way, they do provide a case so you're fine putting them in a bag, but it's large and bulky, so if you're carrying a lot of things in your bag it most defiantly will take a lot of your space. I haven't used it for working out but I personally wouldn't because it slides off my head whenever I look down or move too quickly so it does get irritating.Overall I say buy these headphones if you to really change the way you listen to music, if you're a generally a careful person there shouldn't be a reason for them to break, they just feel a little cheap for the price you pay for.

They have great battery life typically lasting me 2 or more days of use between 6-8 hours a day. The active noise cancelation is great its kind of spooky at first but it becomes very comforting after you get used to it. The passive noise canceling is good too however you can still hear those around you and other important things if you are using them while out running errands and whatnot. Then there is the pass through/ ambient sound mode which in my opinion is only use full when you have it set up through the app to turn this one when it detects you talking because it makes everything very loud even amplifying sounds you might not hear or notice without them.TLDR: Amazing headphones if I could give more than 5 stars I would.","Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2024",AHCCO3CSLWNTYIR3IOXIVDTSVQCA,True,1,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only

RDLWJ8EVJISYF,B08MVGF24M,4.0 out of 5 stars Great 2nd headphones,Jae Lee,4,"To give you some context: I've had 3 ANC/noise cancelling headphones now. The Sony X4s are my third. I started with a $40 pair of Taotronics. These are great for a budget pair of noise cancelling headphones. I moved up to a more expensive pair of Taotronics 90 (~$80). The Sony XM4 is my third and at this junction, I was looking for the following features:1. Better noise cancelling.2. Better comfort, that I would wear longer than an hour).3. Better sound quality (for music and podcast).4. Portability (for traveling).The Sony XM5 just came out so these XM4 were priced at $228. I'm not used to spending this much on headphones but I'm glad I decided to upgraded to these. I was on the fence about the XM5s but the ability to fold the XM4s up, plus the fact that it was priced much less was all the reason I needed to go with the XM4.Things to note about the XM4s:1. ANC - Noise cancelling is great. It covers more of the frequencies than my previous cheap pairs did.2. Ambient Sound - Ambient noise is pretty bad. When you turn noise cancelling off to talk to someone or to hear the outside world, the sound is hollow. If you want ANC headphones where ambient sound comes through clear, these XM4s are not the best. They have the feature but it's not great. Personally, I just take my headphones off when I need to talk to someone. Otherwise, I only wear these with noise cancelling on.3. Comfort - The XM4s are very comfortable. I can easily wear these for 2 hours+ without any discomfort. I've slept in these too (to help me sleep). The ear cushions are soft and pliable enough where I don't feel any pain points. As other reviewers have mentioned, because it does such a good job with noise cancelling, there will be heat that builds up inside, especially if you're exerting energy or wearing these on a wam/hot day. It's not unbearable; just something to note.4. Sound Quality - Sony has an equalizer you can mess with and it helps to fine tune the how music or speech (ie., podcasts) comes through but it's not as good as some of the higher end headphones. But again, for $228, these headphones are a good deal, especially compared to others in the same class.Note: There are other features like the auto-pause, touch navigation (ie., play/pause/next/prev, and volume), and the hand-over-ear to turn ambient noise on... These work fine for me. I like how it works but I don't consider these as PROs or CONs... They're just different and may be useful based on personal preference.Summary: I would highly recommend these noise cancelling headphones at the current price of ~$228. If you want comfort, portability, slightly better sound quality than other comparable/competing brands, this is a very good choice. If you're coming from cheaper-type headphones, these are a great upgrade. If you're on the fence between a much more expensive pair of headphones AND need a pair of affordable headphones straight away, these are a great option. I will likely purchase another in my lifetime but these will work for me for years to come until one that has better sound quality for music and speech becomes affordable [for me].","Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022",AFYCJRL6M67IX6WUPQGN3JQO5ASA,True,4,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

Add in deeper headphone pads like wicked Cushion and you can't lose!!!. I tried my friends M5s and they just didn't fit right and they had begun a crack on the left part right before the slider. I have never seen the M4 do this. Trust me I see people drop headphones almost every night at the gym and every brand. The M5s always break in the same spot. I however never seen a set of M4 s break, ever after a lads ex came in and kicked them halfway across the gym room.Comedy aside the M4s sounds great,even better when you pair it with Sonys app to get the EQ and other settings.Bottom line even when I had the choice to buy Sonys M5s the M4s are much better.

RODXFEQLR1YSO,B08MVGF24M,4.0 out of 5 stars Not the best comfort fit for small heads. The hype for noise cancellation is real!,Sarah,4,"I've been looking for some noise canceling headphones and once these went on sale for Prime day, it was a no brainer that these were the headphones to get. Although there's a newer version out, many reviews have continued to praise this version and its ability to fold in on itself and greater adjustments for the ear cups. My goals for a headset were a lightweight, wireless, and noise canceling to use with my PC, phone, and video game consoles. I didn't really plan on using these for traveling since I prefer to travel very light with just some earbuds.Upon first use, I was amazed by noise canceling ability just by putting it on. Even turned off, the ear cups create a great seal around your ears against outside noise. The sound optimizer is amazing and truly does find a great setting to cancel out the most noise taking into account little details like its placement on your head and atmospheric pressure. Many reviews have stated it feels like you get transported to a different place when you use the headphones because it immerses you into your music and although I can see where they are coming from, there were times I were a bit underwhelmed from its noise canceling ability since I could still hear my fan in the background but when I removed my headphones and realized how loud the fan actually is next to me, I was like alright these are pretty good. When I'm working on my desk, sometimes people sneak up without me knowing because the noise canceling is that effective. The ambient noise with focus on voice doesn't do well when someone is talking to me and does become a hassle to remove every time, versus my Samsung earbuds' ambient mode allows me to talk to others without fully removing them from my ears.Sound quality is great in my opinion and the difference is significant from my daily Logitech headphones. I am using Logitech G435s for my PC for its superior light weight and very light pressure against my head, not really for mic and sound quality. While these headphones' 254 grams weight took some getting used to for me coming from a mere 165 grams headset, it is still quite comfortable to use for long periods of time. In the beginning, I was debating if I should return them because they didn't fit as well on my small head as the small Logitech g435s did and the Sonys ear cups put significant uncomfortable pressure against my jaw and side of head, but after using them as my daily for weeks, the pressure loosened and has become a lot more comfortable. I barely feel any discomfort nowadays, but the pressure against my jaw is still present and noticeable. While snug enough to use for work, these are too loose to use on my small head during exercise. They fall off my head very easily and are too warm for me to use during strenuous activity. These are too expensive to risk breaking at the gym. Because my head is a bit too small for these headphones, I have to be more conscious of the headband placement. I find myself readjusting it on my head more often than my previous headset, but this small annoyance wasn't big enough to warrant a return yet.I really like these headphones and the noise cancellation is amazing! Sound quality is great. However, ambient mode for having conversations without removing the headphones is poor. Battery life is great, but I haven't tested it to its limits yet. Touch gestures and use of buttons have worked well for me, no issues. I'd say that the comfort level is a B tier for my small head, but manageable. Heavier than what I'd like. This is where the headphones score the worst for me, but everything else is pretty good and I'm more than happy with this purchase for the price.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2022",AGIYWPZ2FJWADZSWTIUZ5OQLRSHQ,True,7,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only

R3TUSBANMTQS7N,B08MVGF24M,5.0 out of 5 stars All Inclusive and Fully Delivering,Julian Sanchez,5,"These headphones work perfectly for everything I need them for, be it gaming, work conferencing, or listening to music. The sound quality and customizability is best when used on a phone in conjunction with the app, but it works just fine everywhere else too. I've never received a complaint while on a call with them.I personally listen to plenty of EDM and bass heavy music, and I gotta say that these headphones deliver like none other I've owned. The app again is the most useful in this aspect, allowing full EQ customizing and direct control over the bass quality. Here the noise cancelation can also be set or modes can be set for the adaptive noise cancelation.When the headphones drop the ball a little is when you use a different device which doesn't support the app. At this point they'll default to whatever your last settings were on the app in terms of noise cancelation, EQ, and volume. If you really want to work around this however it's a simple task to pair your phone as the secondary device to the headphones and control them from there while listening to your primary. The auto switch between multiple paired devices depending on audio input is also great, being able to do this fluently was a big factor for me when shopping. Pairing across multiple devices is really easy after the first time paired, most times automatic.The final positive point I'll address is the touch controls on the right ear cup. I've seen many listing this as a fail point for these headphones, and I was hesitant about it at first too due to my previous headphones employing physical buttons. However, I've had no issue with the touch controls and actually find them quite convenient. They're not as sensitive as I've seen some claim, maybe they fixed this in a software patch. I've worn these under a hoodie without triggering the controls.I've been using these almost daily for the past 2 months and I've really only come across two troublesome points. The first is that paradoxically despite having multiple microphones which work during wireless use for calls, when you plug the included aux cable into your device for wired use, the headphones only provide audio and on a call use the connected device's microphone. This was very inconvenient for me as I tried to use the headset in a wired format for game chatting and was held back by the lack of a microphone on the remote, an issue I didn't have with my previous headset. When attempting to make a wired call with my phone in my pocket this became an issue as well for obvious reasons, which is when I first noticed this design.The second issue I've had is one of comfort. Now don't get me wrong these headphones are comfortable and I wear them for multiple hours at a time, but sometimes my left ear enters in discomfort after these extended periods due to the inner design of the left ear cup. As advertised the headphones detect when you take them off and stop playback accordingly, but to accomplish this they use a rather large sensor in the interior of the left ear cup. This sensor ends up pressing against the tip of my ear and becomes annoying after some time, but its not usually an issue and thus not a big enough problem to stop me from wearing them daily for hour long sessions.All in all I fully recommend these headphones as long as the two issues noted above aren't a deal breaker for you. They've served me well and I've felt like I've gotten value for my money.","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2021",AHJFFVMMENIBY5VX736WVMJZCHBA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

I simply tested them in different environments with and without noise canceling activated. Highly effective in isolating from ambient noises like: traffic, loud conversations or just the melange of annoying sounds we are all subjected to on a daily basis. Be aware that if you try to speak to anyone with noise cancelling activated, you'll probably be yelling. Of course the noise cancelling works (for napping or studying) even when no music or other sounds are coming through the speakers. It's just more effective when you're listening to something. One nice feature allows you to on/off the noise cancellation by simply gently pressing the outside of the right earphone. You'll hear a voice prompt saying ""noise cancelling,"" or ""transparency"" (no noise cancellation."") Of course, these headphones won't cancel out all noise, eg., a fire alarm, emergency vehicle etc., but you wouldn't want them to anyway. Again, I have no experience with high end noise cancelling headphones, but these sound great to my non-audiophile ears. There is nice separation between treble, mid-range and bass. Bass is nice and punchy without overwhelming.

Then again I've never used wireless headphones before so I'm not the best reference.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2024",AHYZG2PAQFHIXVWTLFBCJGWWEJOA,True,1,Color: Black

We live on Spotify so good headphones are a must in our family. I only wish they made them in children's size so I could get a pair for my youngest.

R1OTKES7BA4LF7,B08HMWZBXC,5.0 out of 5 stars Seriously worth it!,Amazon Customer,5,"I've had these for a couple years now and they're still some of the very best headphones I've ever owned. The earphone cushions are still in great condition, I wipe mine down after each use to limit oils and hair products from erroding the cushions over time.These headphones are better than both of my Beats and my Skullcandy Crushers. I absolutely love these things. They are offering top dollar sound and quality for bottom dollar and I'm so appreciative.I use them for gaming and work from home calls with clients and people comment on how crystal clear the sound is. I have been able to block out loud noises such as dogs barking and cars, which is why you might want to use the transparency mode when in sketchy settings because the noise cancelling could cause lack of awareness of your surroundings if used in the wrong place.One thing I don't like is how easy it is to bump the transparency setting on the side of the ear phone, it would be better if this were an actual button to press on the headphones to switch over (with a distinct texture so you know what you're pushing without needing to look at it). But, even with that I love these things and would buy more. As a matter of fact, I'm here to buy another pair as a gift for a family member who has tried them and loved them more than their $100+ headphones.","Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2024",AHURJOVIGCI2KT7V7X7CBR6HL4DA,True,4,Color: Black

I just got them today and I wore them for about 10hrs and I was NOT disappointed. I love the noise cancellation vs transparency options.... just a click of the right earpiece button and voila! I read some comments that individuals weren't sure when the device was on/off - keep them on while turning them on/off and you will hear a tone indicating that it is on or off. Super easy to pair to bluetooth. Mine came with about 50% battery, so I recommend charging if you want to take them on a long trip. Again, keep the headphones on when pairing/disconnecting because they tone will help you know whether they are connected or not. There is also a voice indicator when battery is high, medium and low. They are very comfortable and easily adjustable. Honestly, unless you're really picky, you can't beat the quality for the price ($300-$500 is simply not money I want to spend on Apple, Sony or Bose headphones).

I can hear the commuter train announcements much louder than through my more expensive headphones. (Duh.) The bass from outside comes through quite a bit.

Exterior sounds (talking) comes through very tinny. It's so bad I would never use it - you can just hear the muted speech just fine - the noise cancellation isn't good enough to really isolate you from that kind of noise anyway.I find the sound quality good. I tried a few of the preset equalizer settings in the app until I found one that I liked.

WHAT? That’s right. You can not make ANC work if you plug the mfg. provided cable into the headset. It automatically turns the headset off!I also learned the hard way that the ANC turns off after about an hour if you are not listening to something. Try sleeping on an airplane and have the headset just spontaneously shut off. I’ll tell you, it is jarring!Now, couple that with the fact that you can’t plug it into the airline entertainment system to have something to listen to so that the headset doesn’t automatically turn off. Good luck enjoying your ANC on the flight.Now, the mfg. told me it is too late for them to do anything about it for me because it is past their 25 day return window. It is, because I bought it in advance of our planned trip to Germany and didn’t know about the shortcomings until we got back.Oh, by the way, the Q45 will work with their supplied cable plugged into the airline system. Seems they realized that the Q30 not working on ANC with their cable plugged into it was a problem and they corrected it in the Q45.Q30 not recommended if you need ANC working under long air flights.","Reviewed in the United States March 30, 2024",AEFEA37JSMN7ONK2HVNRURKAQMTQ,True,0,Color: Black

I first tried the Space Q45 which is MASSIVE for my head. The Life Q30 is way smaller and lighter so it feels less bulky on the head. The noise cancellation is okay, but for the price point it's decent enough to block out the majority of the engine noise on a plane or any baby screaming on it. It's also great at home where there are trains honking near me as I am near the train line and I have loud roommates. You can hear that people are talking in the background, depending on how loud they are, but I was able to sleep perfectly with these. I have a very small head, so without a hat or hoodie they will slide off if I bend down, so unless you have a child sized head they should work great. The bass is decent enough without boosting and I enjoy music well enough for the price point and convenience of wireless.

R2HIQVVQEQ9AEW,B08HMWZBXC,5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable and sounds good,Raul G,5,"Let me begin by saying that I am not an audiophile by any means. I just know what sounds and feels good. These headphones fit the job. I work from home now more than ever and I use Zoom quite a bit. Therefore, finding a headset that will work with Zoom and which will sound good to others I speak with is extremely important. I know there are headsets which are specifically designed for conference calls, so finding one that does good in this area, including sounding great for music, is a bonus.1. Comfort. This headset is comfortable over all and does not cause me to have ear fatigue like some cheaply made headsets I have tried. However, one thing to note is that if you tend to have a larger head, you might find that this headset tends to press around you with a bit of pressure. This is not unique to this kind of headset, so it's not a flaw, just a FYI.2. Connectivity. I absolutely love the ability to connect with more than one device. I am an Android user and I also love the NFC quick-connect mode it offers. Although, if you don't use this feature and just use regular Bluetooth pairing mode, it will be fine. I constantly switch between Zoom on Windows and my Android phone with little difficulties. Since I don't want it connecting automatically to Windows, I do this manually, and this is okay with me. My only wish for this headset, is that it had a quick mute button on the unit itself, like I have seen with others. If it does and I am not aware of it, I will be happy to be corrected. Meanwhile, if I have to mute, I have to do it from the computer or touch screen.3. Music and books. I listen to 70s and 80s music a lot, plus a lot of Pink Floyd and Def Leppard in general. All music that I have put this baby through so far sounds amazing. Again, I'm not an audiophile, but I know what sounds good to my ears and what does not. The sounds are rich and crisp at the same time. The bass is not too heavy and the audio doesn't sound like I am wearing a tin can on my head. Audio books and podcasts are equally great, but if a headset gets spoken audio wrong, it's not worth keeping.4. Microphones. Sadly, most Bluetooth headsets suffer in this area. You either sound like you are in a tunnel, or you sound like you have a speech impediment. While these headsets aren't a miracle worker in this area, they are not bad at all. When I speak on Zoom, others have reported that there is a bit of bass to my voice, meaning it's not tinny. When I speak on the phone, people report that they can hear me fine, but that it's nothing spectacular.5. Over all thoughts. Considering that there are headsets which cost 2 or 3 times more than this one and don't offer 2 or 3 times the amount of features and flexibility, I think this one is a great buy. For my budget, it's right in the middle. I have purchased headsets that cost over $200 and some that have cost less than $20. These are great right around $70. The only thing I wish was different is that the Soundcore app was better designed. It has a few unlabeled buttons and therefore is not totally accessible if you are blind and rely on TalkBack for Android or Voice Over for iPhone. Other than that, everything else is fine. I especially like the tactile buttons, the ease of charging with USB C, and the ability to fold the headset for portability. In two words, ""highly recommended.""","Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2022",AFSAJAC64RPNXCTMKXQMUCUAJ32A,True,6,Color: Black
R3S72X1H86MB31,B08HMWZBXC,4.0 out of 5 stars A great value for ANC,SHIP,4,"I previously owned ANC earbuds that fit in the ear from Anker which worked well, but I was having some issues with an in-ear device. I purchased this over-ear headset with the same ANC technology and was amazed with the sound quality and ANC in such relatively low price. A great value headset, and also supports multi-device connection. Just be aware -- if you connect to two devices, it will not play simultaneously. It will mute one device when the other one begins making sound, and then switch back when the sound stops. However -- this seems to be standard for multi-device as my Bose headset operates in the same way.With all that said, there is some room for improvement:- Compared to similar headphones from Bose, the button controls are less friendly. A power switch is better IMO than a button you hold down for 3 seconds as you can see at a glance if it is switched on or off and quickly toggle as needed.- The large touch surface of the right ear cup allows you to long press for transparency mode. This is nice, but if you ever stretch your arms above your head your bicep will trigger the long press. Slightly annoying.- The case requires you to put the headphones in a very specific folded orientation. There is a nice label inside the case to remind you of this specific yoga pose the headphones need to make in order to fit. If the mirror image would also work it would not be so big a deal, but it is like a classic USB port where you try, then flip, then try again.- I do like that there are physical buttons for volume, adjusting ANC, play/pause. However -- they are placed exactly where you would grab when taking on/off the headphones or when adjusting the head strap. You have to train yourself to grab the headphones in a different way to avoid hitting these buttons accidentally.- I have not tried it myself -- but I heard that in plugged in mode the ANC does not work. And I heard that it USED to work, but they removed this in a software update. It has not yet affected me as I have never used it in plugged in mode. But not ideal if true.","Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2023",AGROHK4P5JYGVYNQ3TJC3JZ7RNMA,True,3,Color: Black
R12HOPPZFKFOBL,B08HMWZBXC,4.0 out of 5 stars Only one downside,Angela,4,"The sound quality is great, they are super comfortable, easy to connect, and I love the noise cancelling. However, I did purchase these mainly for the gym and although with any upright activity they are great (running, stairmaster, squats), they do slip off my ears when I lay on a bench. They don’t quite fit as tightly as I need them too in order to do any workouts on the ground or even an incline bench. That also just might be due to the size of my head or how much I sweat. Other than that, they are great headphones. But I will be returning and trying to find ones that fit a little more snug for my workouts.","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",AHVBFIYCQI4ULNSSQNYAFMHSXN3A,True,1,Color: Black

I only use them for when I'm working after hours on my computer. Earbuds just don't quite give that extra bang for my music. I've bought headsets like these and they either felt flimsy, didn't cover my ears all the way, or didn't have a quality sound even though I was buying a cheaper pair. But these bad boys, being priced fairly, are awesome! They are lightweight, very comfortable especially covering over my ears completely, and they sound awesome! I don't necessarily need noise cancelation but these have several options of noise handling and that's pretty nice for those who like to block out noise.

R1JCK3PD4FBBWT,B08HMWZBXC,5.0 out of 5 stars Wow,BamaGirl,5,"Ok couldn't not write a review. My hubs needed headphones when his 🍎's went dead, again 🙄. So, I spent WEEKS researching bc I was tired of replacing them & wanted lasting ones. Stumbled upon these from Anker. @ first I was skeptical. Had limited history w/ Anker + it was a LOT cheaper vs. known brands of quality. Why? Be real most companies don't care about the consumer....its about the money. So at first I thought to buy some from Sony; as Amazon had an amazing deal coming up & figured I'd end up having to spend a few hundred for good quality. But I researched some more. Found Anker had amazing customer reviews on a eode range of products & ppl raved about their customer service. And that is one thing for me thats important, the customer service. I think I'm tired of paying crazy prices for something that fits in my hand, costs a pretty penny yet doesn't last at all. So i went with my gut and got these over this past summer. My hubs has been using them consistently since. It EXCEEDS what I expected. SO happy. Lasts at least 5x longer between charging than 🍎 EVER did. He raved that mowing grass is great now....barely hears motor + he can change to hear outside noises IF he wants!?! Came w/ case no extra charge! Looks awesome. SO comfortable (earpieces haven't lost shape or shrunk) + you can wear much longer. Zero issues. Never lost or falls off. It has so many features for personalization, so unique. Don't regret my decision then or now. I've learned a lot about Anker since & bought several more items from them.....ALL have been fantastic! I'm a fan & will stay a Fan *IF* they keep prices awesome for consumers & keep quality like it is now!!! Cannot say enough how unique I believe that is. BIG shout out Anker 🤎🩷💛 please don't change no matter how big you get ok!","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023",AFN2X4744HOFJLJLED7S64MMTXAA,True,3,Color: Black

Bass quality is decent, though personally that's not something I care for much in headphones. They fit snuggly over my ears with minimal discomfort (any discomfort I have is from wearing them continuously for upwards of 7 hours). They charge fairly quickly and I like that they have a USB C charge port. The main cons that I have is that they have a tap feature to quickly change between modes, which itself is nice, however it's so sensitive that barely brushing it can change the mode. I like the idea of the feature, but at least for where I wear them at work, it can be frustrating. Additionally, the battery life could be better, especially for the noise cancelling mode. At first it was great and I felt like I could get about a two and a half days of listening before they'd alert me to charge them, but the battery life started to degrade after a few months. I can still get almost a couple days worth of charge out of them, so it's not a deal breaker. As for noise cancelling, it's about on par for the price. Certainly not Bose or Sony quality, but it works well enough for me and I can usually listen to what I want without too much interference. That said, if there are a lot of people talking, it does come through and I often have to turn up the volume significantly to drown it out to a tolerable level. Again, for the price, it's what I expected. Overall, I'd probably buy them again.","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2024",AFB6HVOFC42OSFGXZS3TSDX6ZY4A,True,0,Color: Black
